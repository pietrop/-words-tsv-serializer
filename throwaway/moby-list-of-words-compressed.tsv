0.5	0.3

0.7	0.7	
0.3	0.2	Why

0.1	0.8	which
0.4	0.9	he

0.6	0.2	
0	0.1	Why

0.4	0.8	
0.5	0.6	Why
0.1	0.9	upon
0.1	0.1	your
0.4	0.6	first
0.2	0.5	voyage
0.6	0.8	as
0.6	0.5	a
1	0.1	passenger,
0.7	0.8	did
0.4	0.8	you
0.4	0.4	yourself
0.6	0.6	feel
0.6	0.7	such
0.9	0.3	a
0.3	0.1	mystical
0.7	0.4	vibration,
0.9	0.9	when
0.3	0.3	first
0.3	0.1	told
0.8	0	that
0.9	0.3	you
0.9	0.1	and
0.9	1	your

0.2	0.9	were
0.5	0.8	now
0.1	0.1	out

0.8	0.6	sight
0.6	0	of

0.8	0.7	
0.6	1	Why
0.1	0.6	did
0.7	1	the

0.8	0.7	Persians
0.6	0.5	hold
0.9	0.2	the
0.5	0.2	sea
0.2	0.5	holy?
0.3	0.3	
0.1	0.5	Why
0.9	0.1	did
0.6	0.9	the

0.5	0.9	give
0.8	0.9	it
0.2	0.3	a

0.5	0.9	brother
1	0.8	of

0.6	0.3	
0.9	0.1	Surely
0.4	0.4	all
0.6	0.5	this
0.6	0.1	is
0.3	0.9	not
0.3	0.9	without
0.6	0.4	meaning.
0.6	0.6	
0.8	0.8	And
0.9	0.6	still
0.9	0.6	deeper
0.8	0.5	the
0.9	0.7	meaning
0.5	0.1	of
0.7	0	that
0.6	0.6	story
0.4	0.3	of
0.6	0.7	Narcissus,
0.4	0.6	who
0.3	0.5	because
0.6	0.9	he
0.2	0.5	could
0.7	0.7	not
0.7	0.6	grasp
1	0.3	the
0.6	0.1	tormenting,
0.8	1	mild
0.7	1	image
0.4	0.9	he
0.7	0.4	saw
0.9	0.6	in
0.2	0.7	the

0.1	0.6	plunged
0.1	0.1	into
0.5	0.3	it
0.9	0.6	and
0.1	0	was
0.7	0.4	drowned.
0.2	0.8	
0.7	0.5	But
0.8	0.5	that
0.9	0.8	same
0.1	0.7	image,
0	0.3	we
0	0.3	ourselves
0.1	0.6	see
0.7	0.7	in
1	0.2	all
0.8	0.8	rivers
0.7	0.6	and
0.8	0.1	oceans.
0.2	0.6	
1	0.7	It
0.9	0.8	is
0.2	0.6	the
0.5	0.6	image
0.5	1	of
0.1	0.6	the
0.2	0.3	ungraspable
1	0.5	phantom
0.6	0.5	of
0.1	0.8	life;
0.4	0.6	and
0.1	0.8	this
0.2	0	is
0.3	0.3	the
0	1	key
0.2	0.3	to
0.7	0.1	it
0.6	0.2	all.
1	0	
0	0.3	Now,
0.3	0.8	when
0.7	0.4	I
0.4	0.2	say
0.9	0.6	that
0.4	0.1	I
0.7	0.2	am

0.7	0.4	whenever

0.9	0.5	about

0.6	0.2	over
0.1	0.6	conscious
0.8	0	of
0.1	0.4	my

0.7	0.7	I

0.7	0.7	For

0.3	0	as
0.1	0.6	a
0.5	0.4	passenger
0.7	0.9	you

0.7	0.3	have

0.6	0.8	and
0.7	0.3	a

0.5	0.9	
0.3	0.5	Besides,
0.5	0	passengers
0.1	0.1	get

0.1	0.6	not
0.4	0.6	enjoy

0.9	0.6	much,
0.7	0.2	as
0.2	0.6	a

0.9	0.5	I

0.9	0.6	
0.8	0.7	I

0.4	0.7	It

0.7	0.4	
0.7	0.2	It

0.3	0.9	I

0.3	0.8	a
0.3	0.8	simple
0.8	0.9	sailor,
1	0.1	right

0.3	0.9	True,
0.3	0.4	they
0.5	0.7	rather

0.8	0.1	
0.2	0.2	And
0.1	0.8	at

0.8	0.1	this
0.6	1	sort
0.4	0.4	of
0.1	0.6	thing
0.5	0.8	is
1	0.8	unpleasant
0.5	0.7	enough.
0.2	0.1	
0.2	1	It
0.2	0.5	touches
0.2	0.6	one's
0.6	0.1	sense
0.6	0.2	of
0.4	0.2	honour,
0.8	0.3	particularly

0.3	0.2	
0.2	0.5	And
0.9	0.8	more
0.4	0.5	than
0.7	0.3	all,
0.9	0.5	if
0.5	0.2	just
0.8	0.3	previous

0.2	0.4	
1	0.2	The
0.1	0.6	transition
0.1	0.3	is
0.8	0.8	a
0.7	0.3	keen
0.4	0.6	one,
0.3	1	I
0.5	0.1	assure

0.3	0.6	schoolmaster
0.6	0.4	to
0.7	0.9	a
0.3	0.8	sailor,
0.1	0.1	and
0.5	0.2	requires

0.1	0.7	decoction
0.3	0.8	of
0.5	0.8	Seneca
0.6	0.6	and
0.6	0	the

0.5	0.2	and
0.5	0.3	bear
0.7	0.6	it.
0.5	0.2	
0.7	0.7	But
0.8	0.4	even
0.9	0.7	this

0.9	0.4	
0.8	0.2	What
0.4	0.9	of

0.1	1	if
0.6	0.8	some

0.7	0.6	
0.8	0.3	What
0.3	0.5	does
0	0.5	that
0.7	0.6	indignity
0.8	1	amount
0.1	0.4	to,
0.5	0.9	weighed,
0.6	0.6	I

0.5	0.9	
0.1	0.8	Do
0.5	0.6	you
0.8	0.4	think
0.1	0.9	the
0.4	0.9	archangel
0.2	0.6	Gabriel
0.5	0.8	thinks
0.1	0.5	anything
0.3	1	the
0.5	0	less
1	0.8	of
0.2	0.8	me,
0.4	0.1	because
0.2	0.5	I
1	0.5	promptly
0.2	0.3	and
0.5	0.2	respectfully
0.4	0.9	obey
0.1	0.2	that

0.1	0.4	
0.4	0.5	Tell
0.6	0.6	me
0.2	0.1	that.
0.5	0.2	
0.7	0.8	Well,
0.3	0.2	then,
0.7	0.3	however
0.5	0.2	the
0.7	0.1	old
0.9	0.8	sea-captains
0.6	0.3	may
1	0.1	order
0.9	0.2	me
0.5	0.2	about--however
0.4	0.7	they
0.2	0.6	may
0.9	0.3	thump
0.1	0.7	and
0.8	0.9	punch
0.3	0.8	me
0.2	0.6	about,
0.3	0.2	I
0.4	0.7	have
0.8	0.8	the
0.5	0	satisfaction
0.3	0.4	of
0.4	0.7	knowing
0.4	0.1	that
0.4	0.7	it
1	0.8	is
0.2	0.8	all
0.2	0.8	right;
0.6	0.9	that
0.4	0.7	everybody
0.1	1	else
0.9	0.3	is
0.6	0.5	one
0.9	0.6	way
0.3	0.4	or
0.2	0.5	other
0.6	0.9	served
0.6	0.9	in
0.9	0.5	much
0.1	0.8	the
0.7	0.5	same
0.3	0.3	way--either
0.1	0.6	in
0.9	0.7	a
0.8	0.3	physical
0.5	0.5	or
0.7	1	metaphysical
1	0.6	point
0.9	0.8	of
0.9	0.5	view,
0.6	0.9	that
0.9	0.7	is;
0.4	0.5	and
0.9	0.8	so
0	0.4	the
0.4	0.8	universal
0.6	0.3	thump
1	1	is
0.3	1	passed
0.3	0.3	round,
0.9	0.9	and
0.4	0.1	all
0.7	0.5	hands
0.8	0.6	should
0.8	0.4	rub
0.3	0.4	each
0.9	0.7	other's

0.9	0.4	and
1	0.8	be
0.5	0.7	content.
0	1	
0.4	0.1	Again,
0.3	0.3	I
0.1	0.3	always
0.9	0.3	go
0.6	0.4	to
0.6	0.9	sea
0.7	0.9	as
0.3	0.4	a
0.2	0	sailor,
0.9	0.3	because
0.9	0.8	they
0.6	0.9	make
1	0.7	a
0.6	0.9	point
0.2	0.6	of
0.3	0.1	paying
0.3	0.8	me
0.8	0.5	for
0.4	0.1	my
0.7	0.2	trouble,
0.1	0.7	whereas
0.5	0.8	they
0.2	0	never
0.6	0.3	pay
0.8	0.6	passengers
0.7	0.9	a
0.7	0.3	single
0.9	0.8	penny
0.4	0.1	that
0.3	1	I
0.9	0.5	ever
0.3	0.1	heard
0.3	0	of.
0.2	0.3	
0.6	0.9	On
0.4	0.9	the
0.9	0.6	contrary,
0	0.7	passengers
0.5	0.9	themselves
0.8	0.1	must
0.3	0.9	pay.
0.9	0.6	
0.8	0.2	And
0.2	0.9	there
0.1	0.7	is
0.7	0.3	all
0.4	0	the
0.6	0.5	difference
0.6	0.9	in
0.2	0	the
0.5	0.9	world
0.1	0.9	between
0.1	0.1	paying
0.2	0.5	and
0.3	0.5	being
1	0.7	paid.
0.8	0.3	
0.7	0.8	The
0.2	1	act
0.3	0.5	of
0.8	0.8	paying
0.6	0.8	is
0.1	0.3	perhaps
0.5	0.5	the
0.8	0.7	most
0.8	0.9	uncomfortable
0.7	1	infliction
0.3	1	that
0.9	1	the
0.2	0.1	two
0.2	0.5	orchard
0.3	0.2	thieves
0.2	0.4	entailed
0.1	0.5	upon
0.9	0.9	us.
0.3	0.7	
0.1	0.9	But
0.7	0.4	BEING
1	0.6	PAID,--what
0.3	0.8	will
0.3	0	compare
0.2	0.7	with
0.1	0.7	it?
0.7	0.2	
0.1	0.5	The
0.9	0.4	urbane
0.8	0.2	activity
0.3	0.7	with
0.7	0.2	which
0.9	0.8	a
0.6	0.1	man
0.1	0.2	receives
0.7	0.7	money
0.8	0.7	is
0.8	0.7	really
0.3	1	marvellous,
0.7	0.9	considering
0.9	0.6	that
0.8	1	we
0	0.5	so
0.1	0.9	earnestly
0.5	0.5	believe
0.8	0.7	money
0.6	0.3	to
0	0.1	be
0.1	0.9	the
0.3	0.3	root
0.7	0.4	of
0.7	0.1	all
0.8	0.7	earthly
0.1	0.2	ills,
0.2	0.8	and
0.4	0.1	that
0.6	0.7	on
0.3	0.4	no
0.7	0.5	account
0.2	0.9	can
0.1	0.4	a
0.4	1	monied
0.6	0.7	man
0.7	0.1	enter
0.9	0.4	heaven.
0.1	0.9	
0.7	0.6	Ah!
0.2	0.1	how
0.8	0.5	cheerfully
0.8	1	we
0.7	0.2	consign
0.9	0.3	ourselves
0.8	0.5	to
0.7	0.3	perdition!
0.1	0.4	
0.9	0.7	Finally,
0.6	0.4	I
0.9	0.9	always
0.4	0.4	go
0.7	0.5	to
0.1	0.1	sea
1	0.4	as
0.4	1	a
1	0.1	sailor,
0.9	0.4	because
0.8	0.7	of
0.5	0.6	the

0.1	0.8	and
0.3	0.1	pure

0.2	0	
0.6	0.3	For
0.8	0.5	as

1	0.2	this
0.1	0.9	world,
0.7	0.5	head
0.9	0.9	winds
0.7	0.2	are
0	0.9	far
0.7	0.8	more

0.1	0.5	from

0	0.8	(that
1	0	is,
0.2	0.8	if

0.8	0.1	on

0.6	0.1	
0.4	0.9	In
0.8	1	much
1	0.8	the
0.2	0.2	same
0.4	0.6	way
0.9	0.4	do
0.8	0.8	the

0.8	0.7	With

0.3	0.5	but

0	0.3	when
0.7	0.5	they

0.6	0.6	nigh
0.1	0.8	enough

0.8	0.3	a

0.5	0.8	from
0.8	0.6	the

0.2	0.3	
0.7	0	Now
0.7	0.8	having
0.1	0.6	a
0.8	0.3	night,
0.4	0.1	a
0.6	0.4	day,
0.9	0.5	and
0.5	0.8	still
0.4	0.3	another
0.5	0.4	night
0	0.7	following
0.6	0.5	before
0.4	0.9	me
0.7	0	in
0.9	1	New
0.4	0.6	Bedford,
0.8	0.3	ere
0.3	0.3	I
0.3	0.9	could
0.9	0.4	embark
0.3	0.1	for
0.2	0.9	my
0.5	0.9	destined
0.3	0	port,
0.5	1	it
0.8	0.3	became
0.2	0.6	a
0.5	0.8	matter
0.1	0.2	of
0.7	0.3	concernment
0.3	0.3	where
0.5	0.1	I
0.4	0.8	was
0.3	0.4	to
0.9	0.4	eat
0.1	0.8	and
0.5	0.7	sleep
0.1	0.1	meanwhile.
0.9	0.2	
0.6	0.5	It
0.7	0.3	was
0.5	0.3	a
0.3	0.5	very
0.3	0.8	dubious-looking,
0.8	0.7	nay,
0.6	0	a
0.7	0.5	very
0.1	0.7	dark
0.5	0.3	and
0.9	0.7	dismal
0.7	0.2	night,
0.2	0.4	bitingly
0.2	0.1	cold
0.4	0.2	and
0.1	0	cheerless.
0.6	0.4	
0.4	0.4	I
0	0.9	knew
0.3	0.6	no
0.1	0.6	one
0.3	0.1	in
0.4	0.4	the
0.6	0.3	place.
0.9	0.8	
0.1	0.6	With
0.2	1	anxious
0.8	0.3	grapnels
0.9	0.9	I
0.9	0.8	had
0.7	0.9	sounded
0.6	0.9	my
0.9	0.8	pocket,
0.4	0.1	and
0.2	0.8	only
1	0.9	brought
1	0.2	up
0.9	0.1	a
0.2	0	few
0.2	0.8	pieces
0.4	1	of
0.5	1	silver,--So,
0.2	0	wherever
1	0.6	you
0.5	0.6	go,
0.8	0	Ishmael,
0.8	0.9	said
1	0.1	I
0.5	0.1	to
0.4	0.4	myself,
0.1	0.6	as
0.2	0.6	I
0.4	0.4	stood
0.4	0.9	in
0.1	0.7	the
0.8	0.2	middle
0.1	0.2	of
1	0.1	a
0.3	0.6	dreary
0.7	0.2	street
0.5	0.5	shouldering
0.4	0.3	my
0.1	0.2	bag,
0.4	0.9	and
0.7	0.6	comparing
0.8	0.6	the
0.3	0.6	gloom
0.8	0.3	towards
0.9	0.4	the
0.8	0.8	north
0.7	0.2	with
0.4	0.4	the
0.2	0.2	darkness
0.5	0.8	towards
0.7	0.9	the
0.8	0.3	south--wherever
0.4	0.1	in
0.3	0.5	your
0.8	0.4	wisdom
0.1	0.3	you
0.5	1	may
0.4	0.3	conclude
0.7	0.5	to
0.6	0.4	lodge
0.2	0.4	for
0.9	0.7	the
0.4	0.6	night,
0.5	0.5	my
0.6	0.9	dear
0.6	0.1	Ishmael,
0.5	0.1	be
0.9	0.9	sure
0.7	0.9	to
0.1	0.6	inquire
0	0.6	the
0.3	0.1	price,
0.9	0.1	and
0.8	0.1	don't
0.2	0.6	be
0.4	0.7	too
0.2	0.8	particular.
0	0	
0.3	0.1	With
0.1	0.3	halting
0.9	0.5	steps
0.3	0.5	I
0	0.6	paced
0.3	0.2	the
0.9	1	streets,
0.9	0.5	and
0.7	0.2	passed
0.8	0.1	the
0.5	0.8	sign
0.1	0.7	of
0.4	0.9	"The
0.5	0.8	Crossed
0.1	0.7	Harpoons"--but
0.5	0.5	it
0.4	0.1	looked
0.8	0.9	too
0.8	0	expensive
0.5	0	and
1	0.9	jolly
0.6	0.3	there.
0.7	0.1	Further
0.7	0.6	on,
0.9	0.3	from
1	0.1	the
0.6	0.1	bright
0.3	0.3	red
0.1	0.2	windows
0.9	0.8	of
0.7	0.1	the
0.2	0.3	"Sword-Fish
0.5	0.4	Inn,"
0.7	0.8	there
0.4	0.7	came
0.3	0.5	such
0.1	0.5	fervent
0.7	0.1	rays,
0.2	0.4	that
0.2	0.9	it
0.4	0.5	seemed
0.8	0.4	to
0.9	0.3	have
0.1	1	melted
0.5	0.6	the
0.5	0.1	packed
0.1	0.3	snow
0.5	0.4	and
0.3	0.9	ice
0.3	0.4	from
0.9	1	before
0.8	0	the
0.5	0.6	house,
0.2	0.6	for
0.5	0.3	everywhere
0.7	0.3	else
0.7	0	the
0.3	0.6	congealed
0.2	0.3	frost
0.6	0.9	lay
0.8	0	ten
0.1	0.9	inches
0.2	0.8	thick
0.6	0.1	in
0.7	0.5	a
0.2	0.7	hard,
0.5	0.8	asphaltic
0.1	0.7	pavement,--rather
0.7	0.6	weary
0	0.1	for
0.6	0.4	me,
0.3	0.2	when
0.9	0.1	I
0.1	0.3	struck
0.9	0.4	my
0.4	0.7	foot
0.6	0.8	against
0.8	0.7	the
0.6	0.8	flinty
0.8	0.2	projections,
0.8	0.3	because
0.4	0.9	from
0.1	0.1	hard,
0	0.9	remorseless
0.2	0.5	service
0.8	0.8	the
0.7	0.7	soles
0.5	0.1	of
0.9	0.4	my
0.9	0.7	boots
0.9	0.1	were
0.7	0.4	in
0.1	0	a
0.9	0.1	most
0.9	0.7	miserable
0.8	0.1	plight.
0	0.5	
0.3	0.6	Too
0.7	0.2	expensive
0.9	0.6	and
0.5	0.8	jolly,
0.1	0.8	again
0.9	0.8	thought
0.4	0.7	I,
0.4	0.7	pausing
0.4	0.8	one
0.4	1	moment
0	0.7	to
0.7	0.1	watch
0.5	1	the
0	0.6	broad
0.3	0.3	glare
0.4	0.8	in
0.4	0.4	the
0.7	0.8	street,
0.2	0.5	and
0.2	0.1	hear
1	0.4	the
0.1	0.6	sounds
0.1	0	of
0.2	0	the
0.2	0.7	tinkling
0.6	0.4	glasses
0.3	0.7	within.
0.5	0.5	But
0.8	0.1	go
0.2	0.9	on,
0.1	0.7	Ishmael,
0.3	0.9	said
0.3	0.7	I
0.2	0.8	at
0.1	0.4	last;
0.8	0.8	don't
0.9	0.9	you
0.7	0.8	hear?
0.1	0.3	get
0.5	0.2	away
0.5	0.1	from
0.1	0	before
0.3	0.9	the
0.3	0.2	door;
0.5	0.1	your
0.1	0.8	patched
0.8	0.3	boots
0.5	0.4	are
0.8	0.8	stopping
0.7	0.4	the
0.2	0.8	way.
0.2	0.8	
0.2	0.6	So
0.7	0.7	on
0.1	0.2	I
0.2	0.1	went.
0.8	0.3	
0.2	0.9	I
0.6	0.9	now
0.9	0.3	by
0.9	0.2	instinct
0.4	0	followed
0.1	0.4	the
0.6	0.3	streets
0.1	0.7	that
0.9	0.1	took
0.9	0.3	me
0.2	0.6	waterward,
0.7	0	for
0.3	0.2	there,
0.2	1	doubtless,
0.8	0.9	were
0.3	1	the
0.3	0.8	cheapest,
0.8	0.1	if
0.8	0.6	not
0.8	0.6	the
0.1	0.8	cheeriest
0.8	0.6	inns.
0.7	0.5	
0.3	1	Such
0.3	0.5	dreary
0.5	0.3	streets!
0.9	0.3	blocks
0.1	0.7	of
0.5	0.4	blackness,
0.9	0.1	not
0	0.5	houses,
0.6	0.2	on
0.3	0	either
0.5	1	hand,
0.6	1	and
0.3	0.8	here
0.2	0.9	and
0.7	0.8	there
0.3	0.9	a
0.2	0.1	candle,
0.6	0.2	like
0.1	0.9	a
0.6	0.2	candle
0.6	0.1	moving
0.1	0.2	about
0	0.2	in
0.3	0.3	a
0.9	1	tomb.
0.8	0.2	
0	0.1	At
0.6	0.4	this
0.5	0.4	hour
0.6	1	of
0.2	0.1	the
0.8	0	night,
0.3	0.8	of
0.3	0.5	the
0.4	0.9	last
0.3	0.9	day
0.4	0.9	of
0.9	0.5	the
0.3	0.3	week,
0.7	0	that
0.3	0.8	quarter
0.1	0.7	of
0.5	0.7	the
0.6	0.4	town
0.6	0.3	proved
0.9	0.9	all
0.5	0.3	but
0.9	0.4	deserted.
0.9	0.4	
0.3	0.6	But
0.6	0.1	presently
0.6	0.7	I
0.1	0.6	came
0.9	0.3	to
0.1	0.5	a
0.2	0.6	smoky
0.9	0.1	light
0.7	0.1	proceeding
0.3	0.9	from
0.2	0.6	a
0.9	0.4	low,
0.5	0.8	wide
0.1	0.1	building,
0.1	1	the
0.9	0.4	door
0.1	0.4	of
0.6	0.4	which
0.1	0.1	stood
0.4	1	invitingly
0.9	0.3	open.
0.2	0.3	
0.3	0.8	It
0.9	0.5	had
0.8	0.5	a
0.6	0.9	careless
0.9	0	look,
0.8	0.1	as
0.7	0.4	if
0.5	0.6	it
0.2	0.9	were
0.2	0.8	meant
0.3	0.7	for
0.9	0.3	the
0.8	1	uses
0.7	0	of
0.4	0.6	the
0.1	0.6	public;
0.3	0.2	so,
0.7	0.1	entering,
0.1	0.5	the
0.4	0.1	first
0.3	0.9	thing
0.8	0.8	I
0.2	0.4	did
0.5	0.7	was
0.3	0.3	to
0.5	0.4	stumble
0.3	0.9	over
0.5	0.3	an
0.6	1	ash-box
0.9	0.6	in
0.7	0.4	the
0.7	1	porch.
0.8	0.6	
0.2	0.4	Ha!
0.1	0.1	thought
0.9	0.8	I,
0.5	0.2	ha,
0.4	0.7	as
0.1	1	the
0.3	0.8	flying
0.1	0.1	particles
0.8	0.5	almost
0.8	0.1	choked
0.7	0.4	me,
0.7	0.9	are
0.6	0.8	these
0	0.3	ashes
0.1	0.7	from
0.5	0.5	that
0.9	0.2	destroyed
0.9	0.2	city,
0.5	1	Gomorrah?
0.6	0	
0.9	0.5	But
0.9	1	"The
0.3	0.9	Crossed
0.9	0.8	Harpoons,"
0.6	0.5	and
0.8	0.6	"The
0.6	0.5	Sword-Fish?"--this,
0	0.5	then
0.6	0.3	must
0.6	0.5	needs
0.5	0.9	be
0.4	0.1	the
1	0.3	sign
1	0.1	of
0.8	0.1	"The
1	0.2	Trap."
0.7	0	However,
0.3	0.6	I
0.9	0.9	picked
0.3	0.8	myself
0.9	0.9	up
0.7	0.9	and
0.1	0.3	hearing
0.6	0.8	a
0.5	0.8	loud
0.9	0.1	voice
0.6	0.9	within,
0.5	0.6	pushed
0.7	0.2	on
1	0.8	and
0.2	0.9	opened
0.4	0.3	a
0.8	0.1	second,
0.4	0.5	interior
0.7	0.4	door.
0.7	0.9	
0.4	0	It
0.9	0.6	seemed
0.4	0.5	the
0.7	0.3	great
0.2	0.3	Black
0.3	0.6	Parliament
1	0.9	sitting
0.6	0.5	in
0.3	1	Tophet.
0.6	0.3	
0.9	0.6	A
0.1	0.6	hundred
0.6	0.8	black
0.1	0.6	faces
0.6	0.3	turned
0.8	0.5	round
1	0.6	in
0.3	0.9	their

1	0.9	to
0.9	0.9	peer;
0.8	0.6	and
0.7	0.3	beyond,
0.6	0.4	a
0.9	0.3	black
0.4	0.2	Angel
0.5	0.6	of
0.6	0.9	Doom
0.4	0.2	was
0.2	0.1	beating
0.9	0.2	a
0.3	0.8	book
0.5	0.1	in
0.5	0.3	a
0.1	0.9	pulpit.
0.8	0.3	
0.7	0.7	It
0.2	0.1	was
0.3	0.7	a
0.1	0.2	negro
0.3	0.7	church;
0.7	0.5	and
0.6	0.6	the
0.7	0.2	preacher's
0.8	0	text
0.7	0.3	was
0.6	0.8	about
0	0.8	the
0.2	0.7	blackness
1	0.2	of
0.1	1	darkness,
0.8	0.9	and
0.6	0.3	the
0.3	0.1	weeping
0.6	0.2	and
0.6	0.2	wailing
0.4	0.2	and
0.5	0.5	teeth-gnashing
0.3	0.1	there.
0.5	0.9	
0.8	0.7	Ha,
0.2	0.4	Ishmael,
0.9	0.7	muttered
0.9	0.4	I,
0	0.4	backing
0.3	0.5	out,
0.7	0.4	Wretched
0.4	0.1	entertainment
0.4	0.1	at
0.4	0.1	the
0.2	0.8	sign
1	0.1	of
0.5	1	'The
0.8	0.3	Trap!'
0.3	0	
0.2	0.5	Moving
0.8	0.8	on,
0.1	0.7	I
0.7	0.9	at
0	0.2	last
0.1	0.1	came
0.8	0.8	to
0.2	0.7	a
0.6	0.3	dim
0.6	0.6	sort
0.8	0.4	of
1	0.7	light
0.9	0.2	not
1	0.3	far
0.7	0.7	from
0.7	0.4	the
0.4	0.2	docks,
0.2	0.7	and
0.9	0.6	heard
0	0.7	a
0.5	1	forlorn
0.5	0	creaking
0.7	0.6	in
0.7	0	the
0.4	0.8	air;
0.7	0.8	and
0.8	0.6	looking
0.6	0.7	up,
0.2	0.3	saw
0.8	0.4	a
0.5	0.1	swinging
0.7	0.5	sign
0.4	0.1	over
0.9	0.2	the
0.5	0.9	door
0.8	0.7	with
1	0.4	a
0.4	0.6	white
0.8	0.4	painting
0.5	0.4	upon
0.1	0.5	it,
0.7	0.1	faintly
0.3	0.9	representing
0.5	0	a

0.9	0.1	straight
0	0.3	jet
0.2	0.6	of
0.7	0.1	misty

0.9	0.8	and
1	0.9	these
0.7	1	words
0.7	0.2	underneath--"The
0	1	Spouter
0.3	1	Inn:--Peter
0.6	0.3	Coffin."
0.2	0.6	
0.9	0.3	Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather
0.3	0.4	ominous
0.4	0.9	in
0.5	0.4	that
0.4	0.3	particular
0.9	0.3	connexion,
0.2	0.2	thought
0.1	0.1	I.
0.6	0.6	
0.8	0.2	But
0.2	0.3	it
1	0.5	is
0.8	0.8	a
0.6	0.5	common
0.3	0.5	name
0.6	0.6	in
0.4	0.1	Nantucket,
0.3	0.2	they
0.8	1	say,
0.3	0.2	and
0.8	0.1	I
0.9	0.3	suppose
0.5	0.5	this
0.2	0.4	Peter
0.6	0.7	here
0.3	0.3	is
0.5	0.8	an
0.1	0.4	emigrant
0.7	0.8	from
0.7	0.9	there.
0.8	0.7	
0.9	0.1	As
0.1	0.3	the
0.8	0.4	light
0.6	0.1	looked
0.6	0.1	so
0.8	0.6	dim,

0.1	0.5	looked
0	0.6	quiet
0.8	1	enough,
0.6	1	and
0.4	0.5	the
0.6	0	dilapidated
0.6	0.2	little
0.1	0.7	wooden
0.5	0.7	house
0.6	0.1	itself

0.7	0.3	I

0.8	0.1	
0.1	1	It

0.2	0.5	a

0.7	0.8	
0	0.4	It
0.6	1	stood
0.1	0.1	on

0.9	0.2	
0.6	0.9	I
0.3	0.9	sought
0.7	0.3	the

0.7	0.8	and
0.5	0.1	telling
0.9	0.2	him
0.7	0.7	I

0.6	0.3	accommodated
0.9	0.7	with
1	0.6	a
0.5	0.5	room,
0.5	0.1	received
0.3	0.3	for
0.5	0.1	answer
0.8	0.2	that
0.5	0.9	his

0.6	0	
0.3	0.6	"But
0.8	0	avast,"
0.4	0.3	he
0.4	0.8	added,

0.9	0.9	forehead,
0.7	0.6	"you

0.2	0.8	
0	0.7	I

0.6	0.9	I
0.4	0.5	should
0.6	0.9	ever
0.5	0.1	do
0.2	0.9	so,
0.9	0.9	it
0.7	1	would
1	0.5	depend
0.2	0.8	upon
0	0.9	who
0.9	0.5	the

0.9	0.5	and
0.5	0.7	that

0.3	0.6	he
0.9	0.7	(the
0.8	0.3	landlord)
0.7	0.2	really

0.1	0.8	the
0.9	0.8	harpooneer
0	0.1	was
0.6	0.2	not
0.1	0.3	decidedly
0.6	0.7	objectionable,
0.9	0.1	why
0.6	0.9	rather
0.9	0.1	than
0.9	0.9	wander
0.5	0.3	further
0.5	0.1	about
0.2	0.7	a
0.8	0.9	strange
0.8	0.6	town
0.5	1	on
0.3	0.5	so
0.4	0.4	bitter
0.7	0.3	a
0.8	0.4	night,
0.6	0.2	I
0.1	0.9	would
0.1	1	put

0.1	0.6	
0.1	0.4	"I

0.3	0	
0.5	1	I
0.6	0.3	sat
0.3	0.9	down
0.9	0.8	on
1	0.6	an

0.3	0.3	still
0.7	0.5	further
0.6	0.8	adorning
0.6	0.4	it
0.2	0.3	with
0.6	0.2	his
0	0.5	jack-knife,
0.8	0.4	stooping
0.2	0.2	over
0.2	0.1	and
0.8	0.1	diligently
0.3	0.4	working

0.2	0.6	at
0.5	0.6	the

0.6	0.5	
0.8	0.8	He

0.5	0.3	under

0.4	1	but
0.7	0.2	he
0.3	0.4	didn't
0.6	0.2	make
0.8	0.4	much
0.1	0.4	headway,
0.1	0.1	I
0.3	0.9	thought.
0.1	0.5	
0.7	0.4	At
0.4	0.8	last
0.7	0.3	some
0.8	0.7	four
0.4	0.3	or
0.5	0.6	five
0.9	0.3	of
0.7	0.8	us
0.1	0.5	were

0.3	0.2	in
0.4	0.1	an
0.2	0.1	adjoining
0.7	0.9	room.
0.9	0.1	
0.9	0.9	It
0.7	1	was
0.8	0.1	cold
0.9	0.5	as
0.3	0	Iceland--no
0.4	0.7	fire
0.8	0.6	at
0.7	0.4	all--the
0	0.1	landlord
0.9	0	said
0.7	0.4	he
0.2	0.3	couldn't
0.8	0.8	afford
0.3	0.5	it.
0.7	0.2	
0.3	0.1	Nothing
0.4	0.4	but
0.8	1	two
0.7	0.8	dismal
0.8	0.1	tallow
0.3	0.7	candles,

0.8	1	
0.8	0.1	We

0.8	0.1	our

0.9	0.5	
0.4	0.4	But
0.6	0.8	the

0.7	0.7	was
0.3	0	of

0.1	0	meat
0.5	0.9	and

0.5	1	addressed
0.1	0.8	himself
0.8	0.5	to
0.8	0	these
0.1	0.6	dumplings
0.1	0.9	in
0.3	0.2	a
0.9	0.4	most

0.8	0.9	manner.
0.3	1	
0.3	1	"My
0.6	0.7	boy,"

0.3	0.1	the

0.8	0.8	"you'll

0.6	0.1	sartainty."
0.2	1	
0.8	0.7	"Landlord,"
0.6	0.1	I

0.7	0.8	
0.1	0.7	"Oh,
0.5	1	no,"
0.2	0.4	said
0.6	0.8	he,
0.1	0.6	looking
0.4	0.7	a
0.7	0.9	sort
0	0.5	of
0.5	0.6	diabolically
0.6	0.8	funny,
0.6	0.8	"the

0.8	0.9	don't--he
0.7	0.3	eats
0.1	0.9	nothing
0	0.5	but

0.1	0.8	and
0.4	0.9	he

0.9	0.3	
0.1	0.8	"The

0.3	0.8	was
0.8	0.6	the
0.8	0.7	answer.
0.4	0.8	
0.5	0.7	I
0.3	0.2	could
0.9	0.1	not
0.1	0.5	help
0.5	0.5	it,
0.8	0.6	but
0.9	0.7	I
0.2	0.6	began

0.7	0.5	At

0.1	0.2	together,
0.3	0.4	he

0.9	0.9	to

0.4	0.1	with

0.7	0.3	I

0.7	0.1	stiff

0.9	0.7	they

0.7	0.6	an
0.8	0.6	eruption
0.6	0.6	of
0.4	0.6	bears
0.1	0.5	from
0.2	0.9	Labrador.
0.7	0.2	
0.6	0.3	They

0.3	0.5	just
0.6	0.5	landed

0.7	0.5	their

0.9	0.1	
0.3	0.9	No
0.9	0.5	wonder,
0.2	0.1	then,
1	0.3	that
1	0.5	they
0.3	0.6	made
0.5	0.1	a
0.3	0.3	straight
0.3	0.1	wake
0.3	0.9	for
0.3	0.7	the
0	0.9	whale's
0.5	0.7	mouth--the

0.6	0.2	the
0.8	0.9	wrinkled

0.5	0.5	old
0.3	0.7	Jonah,
0.6	0.1	there
0.7	0.3	officiating,
0.9	0.2	soon

1	0.5	them
0.8	0.6	out
0.6	0.7	brimmers
0.9	0	all
0.1	1	round.
0	0.3	
0	0.6	One
0.7	0.7	complained
0.7	0.9	of
0.9	0.6	a
0.9	0.9	bad
0.6	0.5	cold
0.7	0.4	in
1	0.8	his
0.8	0.2	head,
0.1	0.5	upon

0.9	0.8	Jonah
0.6	0.5	mixed
0.1	0.7	him
0.4	0.9	a

1	0.2	potion
0.2	0.1	of
0.9	0.8	gin
0.5	0.9	and
0.8	0.4	molasses,
0.2	0.4	which
0.5	0.8	he
0.1	0.9	swore
0.4	0.9	was
0.5	0.5	a
0.2	0.9	sovereign
0.5	0.7	cure
0.8	0.8	for
0.6	0.1	all
0.9	0.1	colds
0.4	0.3	and

0.5	0.8	whatsoever,
0.3	0.5	never
0.3	0.3	mind
0.1	0.1	of
0.2	0.8	how
0.2	1	long
0.9	0.7	standing,
0.2	1	or
0.7	0.1	whether
0.1	0.2	caught

0.2	0.8	
0.8	0.8	The
0.9	0.3	liquor
0.8	0.6	soon
0.8	0.4	mounted
0.3	0.1	into
0.7	0.8	their
0.7	0.8	heads,
0.9	0.2	as
0.1	0.1	it
0.1	0.2	generally
0.2	0.7	does
0.1	0.8	even
0.4	0.8	with
0	0.9	the
0.8	0.9	arrantest
0.4	0.5	topers
0.5	0.4	newly
0.7	0.6	landed
0.7	0.1	from
0.2	0.2	sea,
0.1	0.3	and
0.1	0.8	they
0.4	0.8	began
0.1	0.2	capering
0.3	0.3	about
0.2	0.4	most
0.3	0.8	obstreperously.
0.4	0.3	
0	0.7	I
0	0.5	observed,
0.7	0.2	however,
0.5	0.5	that
0.8	1	one
0.8	0.1	of
0.5	0.9	them
0.4	0.9	held
0.3	0.8	somewhat
0.4	0.6	aloof,
0.1	0.5	and
0.5	1	though
0.3	0.9	he
0.5	0.9	seemed
0.4	0.1	desirous
0.9	0	not
0.1	0.6	to
0.9	0.3	spoil
0.5	0.5	the
0	0.9	hilarity
0.8	0.4	of
0.8	0.6	his
0.1	0.9	shipmates
0.6	0.5	by
0.6	0.8	his
0.9	0.3	own
0.9	0.3	sober
0.6	0.1	face,
0.5	0.6	yet
0.1	0.6	upon
0.7	0.3	the
0.2	0.1	whole
0.8	0.7	he
0.8	0.7	refrained
0.2	0.4	from
0.5	0.9	making
0.3	0	as
0.5	0.1	much
0.7	0.1	noise
0.7	0.1	as
0.1	0.6	the
1	0.8	rest.
0.5	0.4	
0.5	0.1	This
0.3	0.1	man
0.4	1	interested
0.4	0.3	me
1	0.3	at
0.5	0.8	once;
0.6	0.6	and
0.9	0.8	since
0.3	0.8	the
0.7	0.9	sea-gods
0.7	0.8	had
0.8	0.1	ordained
0.7	0.8	that
0.1	0	he
0.2	0.5	should
0.2	0.9	soon
0.6	0.1	become
0	0.2	my
0.8	0.5	shipmate
0.5	0	(though
0.7	0.6	but
0.1	0.2	a
0.4	0.9	sleeping-partner
0.2	0.5	one,
0.8	0.7	so
0.6	0.4	far
0.7	0.5	as
0.9	0.3	this
0.5	0.5	narrative
0.8	1	is
0.7	0.8	concerned),
1	0.8	I
0.7	0.2	will
0.5	0.4	here
0.6	0.3	venture
0	0.2	upon
0.8	0.2	a
0.9	0.1	little
0.2	0.8	description
0.4	0.4	of
0.4	0.7	him.
0.8	0.1	
0.6	0.5	He
0.3	0.2	stood
0.1	0.6	full
0.2	0.3	six
0.5	0.6	feet
0.5	0.8	in
0.5	0.1	height,
0.4	0.4	with
0.1	0.9	noble
0.1	0.5	shoulders,
0.2	1	and
0.6	0.9	a
0.2	0.5	chest
0.4	1	like
0.4	0.2	a
0.9	0.1	coffer-dam.
0.9	0.7	
0.6	0.7	I
0.2	0.5	have
0.9	0.1	seldom
0.9	0.7	seen
0.6	0.8	such
0.5	0.5	brawn
0.4	0.5	in
0.2	0.4	a
0	0.8	man.
0.7	0.7	
0.2	0	His
0.1	0.2	face
0.7	0.6	was
0.9	0.7	deeply
0.4	0.7	brown
0.2	0.2	and
0.8	0.3	burnt,
0.9	0.5	making
1	0.4	his
0.5	0.4	white
0.8	1	teeth
0.1	0.6	dazzling
0.4	0.8	by
0.9	0.6	the
0.9	0.7	contrast;
0.9	0.6	while
0.4	0.9	in
0.3	0.9	the
0.1	0.1	deep
0.3	0.3	shadows
0.6	0.9	of
0.2	0.3	his
0.2	0	eyes
0.9	0.7	floated
0.1	0.7	some
0	0.8	reminiscences
0.3	0.3	that
0.9	0.2	did
0.1	0.2	not
0.5	0.1	seem
0.3	0.9	to
0.2	0.9	give
0.5	0	him
0.8	0.2	much
0.3	0.1	joy.
0.6	0.3	
0.1	0.5	His
0.3	0.1	voice
0.1	0.1	at
0.4	1	once
0.4	0.1	announced
0.8	0.9	that
0.7	0.8	he
0.1	0.5	was
0.4	0.2	a
0.9	0.2	Southerner,
0.5	0.8	and
0.7	0.2	from
0.2	0.3	his
0.3	0.8	fine
0.5	0.4	stature,
0.5	0.3	I
1	0.9	thought
0.9	0.4	he
0.3	0.2	must
0.7	0.2	be
0.3	0.4	one
0.9	0.7	of
0.8	0.3	those
0.3	0.4	tall
0.3	0.8	mountaineers
0.2	0.4	from
0.6	0.5	the
1	1	Alleghanian
0.5	0.6	Ridge
0.1	0.5	in
0.5	0.5	Virginia.
0.1	0.3	
0.1	0.7	When
0.7	0.7	the
0.7	0.7	revelry
0.8	0.2	of
0.3	0.1	his
0.2	0.8	companions
0.2	0.6	had
0.8	1	mounted
0.6	0.9	to
0.2	0.7	its
0.7	0.6	height,
0.6	0.3	this
0.9	0.1	man
0.1	0.5	slipped
0.1	0.3	away
0.4	0.1	unobserved,
0	0.6	and
0.5	0.3	I
0.6	0.8	saw
0.8	0.9	no
0.9	0.5	more
0.4	0.3	of
0.6	0.6	him
0.7	0.8	till
0.1	0.3	he
0.2	0.1	became
0.9	0.3	my
0.1	0	comrade
0.3	0.1	on
0	0.2	the
0.7	0.2	sea.
0.4	0.1	
0.3	0.9	In
0.7	0.3	a
0.9	0.1	few
0.9	1	minutes,
0.3	0	however,
0.5	0.1	he
0.5	0.7	was
1	0.5	missed
1	0.3	by
0.5	0.9	his
0.1	0.4	shipmates,
0.8	0.9	and
0.8	0.1	being,
0.2	1	it
0.6	0.6	seems,
0.1	0.2	for
0.4	0	some
0.1	0.8	reason
0.8	0.7	a
0.5	0.2	huge
0.3	0.1	favourite
0.2	0.3	with
0.1	0.5	them,
0.8	0.3	they
0.5	0	raised
0.1	1	a
0.6	0.3	cry
0.3	0.7	of
0.6	0.4	"Bulkington!
0.2	0.9	
0.2	0.7	Bulkington!
0.7	0	where's
0.7	0.5	Bulkington?"
0.5	0.4	and
0.3	0.6	darted
0.7	0.1	out
0.8	0.3	of
0.1	0.1	the
0.4	0.1	house
0.8	0.1	in
0.6	0.7	pursuit
0.6	0.4	of
0.4	0.5	him.
0.8	0.6	
0.4	0.9	It
0.9	0.1	was
0.3	0.9	now
0.1	0.2	about
0.3	0.7	nine
0.4	0.4	o'clock,
0.7	0.8	and
0.2	0.3	the
0.9	0.4	room
0.7	0.7	seeming
0.2	0.7	almost
0.6	0.8	supernaturally
0.8	0.8	quiet
0	0.8	after
0	0.7	these
0.7	0.9	orgies,
0.2	0	I
0.4	0.3	began
0.4	0.4	to
0.9	0	congratulate
0.5	0.8	myself
0.8	0.2	upon
1	0.8	a
0.9	0.7	little
1	0.6	plan
0.7	0.4	that
0.3	0.7	had
0.9	0.9	occurred
0.5	0.8	to
0.5	0.8	me
0.6	0.3	just
1	0.2	previous
0.2	0.7	to
0.1	0.1	the
0.8	0.7	entrance
0.6	0.4	of
0.1	0.7	the
0.8	0.3	seamen.
1	0.8	
0.3	0.2	No
0.8	0.6	man
0.5	0.2	prefers
0.3	0.4	to
0.1	0	sleep
0.5	0.1	two
0.1	0.8	in
0.6	0.5	a
0.2	0.7	bed.
0.9	0.1	
0.4	0.1	In
0.4	0.6	fact,
0.5	0.4	you
0	0.4	would
0.3	0.3	a
0.5	0.1	good
1	0.5	deal
0.8	0.6	rather
0.5	0.8	not
0.4	0.9	sleep
1	0.5	with
1	0.9	your
0.7	0.8	own
0.5	1	brother.
1	0.8	
0	0.3	I
0.6	0.4	don't
0.3	0.8	know
0	0.7	how
0.4	0.8	it
0.7	0.3	is,
0.1	0.9	but
0.8	0.6	people
0	0.6	like
0.1	0.5	to
0.2	0.1	be
0.1	0.9	private
0.5	0	when
0.5	0.5	they
0	0.1	are
0.1	0.1	sleeping.
0.2	0.2	
0.4	0.4	And
1	1	when
0.3	1	it
0.7	0.6	comes
0.8	0	to
0.1	0.8	sleeping
0.7	0.3	with
0.7	0.7	an
0.6	0.9	unknown
0.5	0.2	stranger,
0.3	0.1	in
0.9	0.6	a
0.9	0.9	strange
0.8	0.3	inn,
0.1	0.8	in
0.6	0.9	a
1	0.9	strange
0	0.2	town,
0.8	0.1	and
0.9	0.4	that
0.1	0.8	stranger
0.5	0.2	a
0.3	0	harpooneer,
0	0.5	then
0.5	0.8	your
0.5	0.7	objections
0.8	0.1	indefinitely
0.1	0.2	multiply.
0.2	0.6	
0.1	0.4	Nor
0.4	0.6	was
0.9	0.8	there
0.9	0.8	any
0.2	0.3	earthly
0.5	0.9	reason
0.1	0.2	why
0.7	0.5	I
0.6	0.7	as
0	0.6	a
0.4	0	sailor
0.6	0.4	should
0.3	0	sleep
0.8	0.5	two
0.5	0.5	in
0.3	0.7	a
0.4	0	bed,
0.5	1	more
0.9	0.8	than
0.4	0.6	anybody
0.4	0.8	else;
0.8	0.5	for
0.6	0	sailors
0.6	0.9	no
0.2	0.4	more
0.6	0.7	sleep
0.6	0.6	two
0.6	0.6	in
0.2	0.4	a
0.7	0.3	bed
0.3	0.4	at
0.3	0.3	sea,
0.5	0.1	than
0.7	0.7	bachelor
0.8	0.5	Kings
0.7	0.1	do
0.2	0.1	ashore.
0.9	0.8	
0.3	0.4	To
0.9	0.1	be
0.8	0	sure
0.3	0.2	they
0	0.5	all
0.8	0.5	sleep
0.1	0.8	together
0.7	1	in
0.1	0.7	one
0.4	0.5	apartment,
0.8	0.5	but
0.3	0.7	you
0.3	0.6	have
0.4	0.3	your
0.6	0.1	own
0.8	0.7	hammock,
0.9	0.2	and
0.7	0.6	cover
0.1	0.8	yourself
0.8	1	with
0.1	0.3	your
0.5	0	own
0	0.6	blanket,
0.1	0.4	and
0.9	0.7	sleep
0.9	0.6	in
0.8	0.8	your
0.7	0.8	own
0	0.7	skin.
0.3	0.7	
0.3	0.8	The
0.8	0.7	more
0.1	0.1	I
0.5	0.6	pondered
0.6	0.5	over
0.3	0.4	this
0.6	0.7	harpooneer,
0.4	0.1	the
0.2	0.5	more
0.7	0.7	I
0.7	0.7	abominated
0.3	0.2	the
0.3	0.6	thought
0	0	of
0.9	0.3	sleeping
0.4	0.3	with
0.1	0.3	him.
0.5	0.2	
0.4	0.1	It
0.8	0.5	was
0.1	0.2	fair
0.5	0.9	to
0.2	0.8	presume
0.5	0.4	that
0.6	0.1	being
0.8	0.1	a
0.2	0	harpooneer,
0.4	0.5	his
0.4	1	linen
0.7	0.3	or
0.6	0.3	woollen,
0.6	0.1	as
1	0.1	the
0.9	0.7	case
0.1	1	might
0.2	0.4	be,
0.2	0.4	would
0.3	0.2	not
0.6	1	be
0.3	0.8	of
0.9	0.8	the
0.5	0.3	tidiest,
1	0.3	certainly
1	0.3	none
0.3	0	of
0.9	0.9	the
0	0.3	finest.
0.2	0.8	
0.1	0.6	I
0.9	0.6	began
0.6	0.3	to
0.7	0.9	twitch
0	0.7	all
0.3	0.8	over.
0.5	0.5	
0.1	0.9	Besides,
0.7	0.5	it
0.7	1	was
0	0.4	getting
1	0.2	late,
0.4	0	and
0.6	0.8	my
0.1	0.4	decent
0	0.9	harpooneer
1	0.3	ought
0.1	0.6	to
0.2	0.3	be
0.4	0.4	home
0.7	0.1	and
0.6	0.6	going
0.8	0.5	bedwards.
0.6	0.7	
0.6	0.4	Suppose
0.8	0.5	now,
0.3	0.1	he
0.4	0.4	should
0.4	0.5	tumble
0.6	0.8	in
0.7	0.9	upon
0	0.2	me
0.2	0.2	at
0.7	0.9	midnight--how
0.8	0.2	could
1	0.3	I
0.5	0.7	tell
0.2	0.3	from
0.1	1	what
0.6	0.3	vile
0.2	0.7	hole
0.2	0.4	he
0.3	1	had
0.4	0.9	been
0.9	0.5	coming?
0.9	0.5	
0.1	0.2	"Landlord!
0.3	0.7	
0.2	0.6	I've
0.6	0.9	changed

1	0.1	sleep
0.1	0.2	with
0.8	0.1	him.
0.5	0.4	
0.6	0.4	I'll
0	0.3	try
0.6	0.9	the

0.9	0.6	here."
0.1	1	
0.3	0.1	"Just
0.5	0.4	as

0.8	0.8	please;
0.3	0.5	I'm

0.8	0.3	So
0.3	0.9	saying
0	0.3	he

0.7	0.8	with
0.8	0.6	his
0.8	0.9	old
0.9	0.3	silk
0.9	0.3	handkerchief
0.2	0.2	first
0.6	0.3	dusting
0.4	0.9	the
0	0.8	bench,
0.5	0.5	vigorously
0.3	1	set
0.3	0.5	to
0.3	0.6	planing
0.5	0.8	away
0.2	0.1	at
0.4	0.8	my
0.4	0.5	bed,
0.8	0.3	the
0.3	0.2	while
1	0.1	grinning
0.7	0.3	like
0.5	0.2	an
0.8	0.9	ape.
0.4	0.9	
0.9	0.2	The
0.3	0.6	shavings
0.2	0.7	flew
0.7	0.6	right
0.5	0.9	and
0.7	0.1	left;
0.6	0.8	till
0.3	0.8	at
0.1	0.2	last
0.4	0.8	the
0.8	0.8	plane-iron
0.9	1	came
0.3	0.3	bump
0.3	0.2	against
0.9	0.6	an
1	0.2	indestructible
0.6	0.8	knot.
0	0.2	The
0.8	0.4	landlord
0.6	0.3	was
0.8	0.7	near
0.7	1	spraining
0.9	0.9	his
0.3	0.5	wrist,
0.9	0.5	and
0.7	0.5	I
0.2	0.8	told
0.4	0	him
0.8	0.7	for
0.1	0.6	heaven's
0.6	0.6	sake
0.4	0.2	to
0.4	1	quit--the
0.4	0.8	bed
1	0.6	was
1	0.1	soft
0.5	0.1	enough
0.3	0.7	to
0.3	0.1	suit
0	0.4	me,
0.1	0.2	and
0.2	0.9	I
0.7	0.1	did
0.8	0.9	not
0.9	0.4	know
0.3	0	how
0.4	0.1	all
0.4	0.6	the
0.3	0.1	planing
0.9	0.2	in
0.4	0.5	the
0.1	0.6	world
0.5	0.4	could
0	0.6	make
0.6	0.2	eider
0.6	1	down
0.3	0.3	of
0.1	0.4	a
0.7	1	pine
0.3	1	plank.
0	0.2	
0.7	0.5	So
0.8	0.3	gathering
0.6	0.6	up
0.1	0.3	the
0.3	0.8	shavings
0.7	0.4	with
0.2	0.2	another
0.4	0.8	grin,
0.4	0.3	and
0.7	1	throwing
0.5	0.6	them
0.9	0.3	into
0.7	0.8	the
0.1	0.9	great
0.3	0	stove
0.3	0	in
0.3	0.3	the
0.9	0.3	middle
0.4	0.9	of
0.8	0.7	the
0.9	0.8	room,
0.3	0.7	he
0.6	0.4	went
1	0.7	about
0.5	0.3	his
0.9	0.9	business,
0.3	0.3	and
0.2	0.2	left
0.7	0.3	me
0.3	0.5	in
0.3	0.1	a
0.8	0.4	brown
0.4	0.4	study.
0.3	0.9	
0.9	0.5	I
0.7	0.9	now
1	0.7	took
0.3	0.4	the
0.3	1	measure
0.1	0.8	of
0.5	0.5	the
0.9	0.1	bench,
0.3	1	and
0.6	0.7	found
0.2	0.9	that
0.1	0.1	it
0.7	0.1	was
0.8	0.8	a
0.3	0.6	foot
0.4	0.3	too
0	0.2	short;
0.3	0.3	but
0.7	0.3	that
0.3	1	could
0.6	0	be
0	0.6	mended
0.7	0.3	with
0.4	0.3	a
0.4	0.1	chair.
0.2	0	
0.8	0.6	But
0.2	0.4	it
0.1	0.4	was
0.5	0.5	a
0.1	0.6	foot
0.2	0.5	too
0.5	0.8	narrow,
0.3	0.3	and
0.1	0.9	the
0.7	0.2	other
0.9	0.5	bench
0.6	0.9	in
0.1	0.9	the
0.4	0.4	room
0.9	0.1	was
0.7	0.7	about
0.5	0.4	four
0.8	0.1	inches
0.6	0.2	higher
0.3	0.3	than
0.8	0.7	the
0.8	0.6	planed
0.6	0.5	one--so
0	0.4	there
0.9	0.7	was
0.5	0.2	no
0.5	0	yoking
0.5	0.8	them.
0.2	0.7	
0.4	0.5	I
0.4	0.7	then
0.7	0.1	placed
0.6	0.8	the
0.9	0.1	first
0.7	1	bench
0.5	0.1	lengthwise
0.7	0.7	along
0.1	0.6	the
0	0.8	only
0.3	0.5	clear
0.7	1	space
1	0.3	against
0.7	0.9	the
0.3	0.8	wall,
0.1	0.7	leaving
0.5	0.1	a
0	0.6	little
0.8	0.1	interval
0.4	0.8	between,
0.1	0.5	for
0.6	0.1	my
1	0.7	back
0.3	0.7	to
0.8	0.6	settle
0.6	0.4	down
0.8	0.9	in.
0.2	0.7	But
0.1	0.7	I
0.1	0.8	soon
0.5	0.9	found
0.3	0.5	that
0	0.3	there
0.4	0.5	came
0.9	0.8	such
0	0.9	a
0.7	0.5	draught
0.9	0.8	of
0.1	0.1	cold
0.5	1	air
0.9	0.9	over
0.9	0.8	me
0.3	0.4	from
0.3	0.6	under
0.2	1	the
0.6	0.2	sill
0.5	0.4	of
0.2	0.3	the
0.5	0.2	window,
0.1	0.6	that
0.3	0	this
0.7	0.7	plan
0.1	0.4	would
0	0.6	never
0.1	0.7	do
0.7	0.4	at
0.2	0.3	all,
0.4	0.4	especially
0.4	0.1	as
0.4	0.7	another
0.4	0.2	current
0.1	0	from
0.1	0.1	the
0.7	0.7	rickety
0.7	0.5	door
0.9	0.9	met
0.2	0.6	the
0.6	0.4	one
0.8	0.4	from
0.1	0.7	the
0.8	0.8	window,
0.3	1	and
0.7	1	both
0.8	0.7	together
0.5	0.1	formed
0.1	0.2	a
0.9	0.3	series
0.8	0.9	of
0.5	0	small
0.2	0.8	whirlwinds
0.7	0.9	in
0.8	0.8	the
1	0.1	immediate
0.5	0.6	vicinity
1	0	of
0.9	0.1	the
0.5	0.7	spot
0.5	0.3	where
0.1	0.4	I
0.7	0.7	had
0.5	0.1	thought
0.3	0.2	to
0.2	0.2	spend
0.9	0.2	the
0.6	0.3	night.
0.5	0.1	
0.5	0.3	The
1	1	devil
0.4	0.4	fetch
0.2	0.6	that
0.9	0.9	harpooneer,
0.3	0.3	thought
1	0.1	I,
0.7	0.9	but
0.4	0	stop,
0.7	0.4	couldn't
1	0.2	I
0.5	0.4	steal
0.3	0.3	a
0.7	0.7	march
0.8	0.9	on
0.6	0.3	him--bolt
0.9	0.4	his
0.3	0.3	door
0.5	0.3	inside,
0.3	0.9	and
0.7	0.8	jump
0.8	0	into
0	0	his
0.3	0.3	bed,
0.3	0.4	not
0.2	0.1	to
0.1	0.7	be
0.6	0.3	wakened
0.7	0	by
0.9	0.9	the
0.1	0.5	most
0	1	violent
0.3	0.3	knockings?
0.5	0.3	
0.3	0.5	It
0.8	0.7	seemed
0.8	0.8	no
0	0.2	bad
0.9	0.1	idea;
0.6	0.1	but
0.9	0.2	upon
0.5	1	second
0.9	0.9	thoughts
0.1	0.1	I
0.7	0.4	dismissed
0	0.1	it.
0	0.8	
0	0.5	For
0.5	0.2	who
0.5	0.1	could
0.5	0.9	tell
0.6	0.4	but
1	0.7	what
1	0.1	the
0.8	0.6	next
0.9	0.8	morning,
0.1	0.5	so
0.8	0	soon
0.4	0.2	as
0.8	0.2	I
0.4	0.9	popped
0.5	1	out
0.9	0.4	of
0	0	the
0.4	0.4	room,
0.2	0.7	the
0.4	0.1	harpooneer
0.7	0.5	might
0.1	0.1	be
0.7	0.8	standing
0.9	0.5	in
0.7	0.1	the
0.2	0.4	entry,
0.8	0.7	all
0.9	0.1	ready
0.1	0.3	to
1	0.3	knock
0.4	0.1	me
0.3	0.8	down!
0.1	0.1	
0.2	0.5	Still,
0.7	0.1	looking
0.9	0.4	round
0.5	0	me
0.1	0.5	again,
0.4	0.7	and
0.3	0.1	seeing
0.8	0.1	no
0.9	0.3	possible
0.6	0.6	chance
0.7	0.3	of
0.3	0.5	spending
0.8	0.5	a
0.5	0.4	sufferable
0.9	0.5	night
0.4	0.1	unless
0.2	0.1	in
0.3	0.6	some
0.9	0.1	other
0.1	0.7	person's
0.7	0.5	bed,
0.3	0.2	I
0.9	0.7	began
0.8	0.8	to
0.9	0.9	think
0.8	0.6	that
0.3	0.4	after
0	0.4	all
0.4	1	I
0.8	0.2	might
0.8	0.5	be
0.8	0.6	cherishing
0.1	0.5	unwarrantable
0	0.6	prejudices
0.4	0.7	against
1	0.8	this
0.4	0.3	unknown
0.6	0.1	harpooneer.
0.8	0.1	
0.5	0.2	Thinks
0.3	0.8	I,
1	0.7	I'll
0	0.9	wait
0.3	0.2	awhile;
0	0.6	he
0.1	0.7	must
0.5	0.2	be
0.6	0.2	dropping
0.5	0.7	in
0.3	0.5	before
0.8	0.6	long.
0.1	0.7	
0.2	0.5	I'll
0.3	0.2	have
0.6	0.2	a
0.9	0.9	good
0.5	0.4	look
0.1	0.3	at
0.1	0.4	him
0.5	0	then,
0.8	0.6	and
0.6	0.1	perhaps
1	0.8	we
0.5	1	may
0.1	0.1	become
0.4	0.6	jolly
0.9	0.7	good
0.7	0.9	bedfellows
1	0.9	after
0.7	0.3	all--there's
0.7	0.3	no
0.9	0.5	telling.
0.3	0.3	
0.8	0.6	But
0.5	0.1	though
0.5	0.9	the
0.9	0.7	other
0.2	0.1	boarders
0.3	0	kept
0.5	0.2	coming
0.3	0.7	in
0.6	0.7	by
0.1	0.2	ones,
0.2	0.2	twos,
0.1	0.1	and
0.1	0.6	threes,
0.5	0.9	and
0.4	0.6	going
0.4	0.6	to
0.4	0.4	bed,
0.9	0.5	yet
0.2	0.4	no
0.5	0	sign
0.7	0.9	of
0.4	0.1	my
0	0.1	harpooneer.
0.4	0.4	
0.6	0.9	"Landlord!
0.6	1	said
0.9	0.8	I,
0.7	0.2	"what
0.2	0.2	sort
0.2	0.5	of

0.4	0.5	hours?"
0.2	0.8	
0.2	0.6	It
0.8	0.6	was
0.5	0.7	now
0.8	0.8	hard
0.8	0.2	upon

0.2	0.1	o'clock.

0.2	0.5	The
0.9	0.1	landlord
0.4	0.3	chuckled
0.5	0.2	again
0.7	0.7	with
0.3	0.9	his
0.6	0.3	lean
0.4	0.5	chuckle,
0.3	1	and
0.8	0.7	seemed
0.7	1	to
0.3	0.8	be
0.4	0.1	mightily
0.9	0.5	tickled
0.3	0.5	at
0.2	0.3	something
0.1	0.8	beyond
0	0.6	my
0.8	0.8	comprehension.
0.4	0.6	
0.8	1	"No,"
0	0.1	he
0	0.8	answered,
0.3	0.2	"generally
0.9	0.9	he's

0.3	0.3	
0.9	0.3	But
0.1	0	I
0	0.6	stood
0.7	0.1	irresolute;
0.2	0.4	when
0	0.1	looking
0	0.4	at
0.1	0.9	a
0.7	0.2	clock
0.8	0.1	in
0.3	0.4	the
0	0.7	corner,
0.4	0.7	he
0.1	0.6	exclaimed
0.6	0.3	"I
0.6	1	vum
0.2	0.6	it's
0.9	0.9	Sunday--you
0	0.9	won't
0.3	0.1	see
0.7	0.8	that
0.8	0.5	harpooneer
0.6	0.8	to-night;
0.7	0.1	he's
0.7	0.5	come
1	0.2	to
0.1	0.4	anchor
0.7	0.7	somewhere--come
0	0.6	along
0.1	0.3	then;
0.5	0.9	DO
0.5	0.6	come;
0.2	0.7	WON'T
0	0.9	ye
0.8	0.3	come?"
0.6	0.2	
0.7	0.9	I
0.2	0.7	considered
0.3	0.2	the
0.6	0.7	matter
0.1	0.1	a
0.2	0.6	moment,
0.5	0.5	and
0.6	0.7	then
0.2	0.3	up
0.2	0.8	stairs
0.1	0.5	we
0.9	0.8	went,
0.4	0.1	and
0.5	0.2	I
0.4	0.7	was
0.3	0.7	ushered
0.1	0.4	into
0.7	0.8	a
0	0.7	small
0.8	0.5	room,
0.9	0.3	cold
0.8	0.4	as
0.3	0.4	a
0.1	0.9	clam,
0	0.1	and
0.4	0.9	furnished,
0.2	0.6	sure
0.5	0.3	enough,
0.8	0.2	with
0.4	0.3	a
0.4	0.8	prodigious
0.9	0.6	bed,
0.1	0.8	almost
0.9	0.7	big

0.5	0.4	abreast.
0.6	0.8	
0.7	0.9	"There,"
0.2	0.1	said
0.6	0	the
0.1	0.1	landlord,
0.6	0.6	placing
0.2	0.4	the
0.5	0	candle
0.7	0.8	on
0.8	0.7	a

0.5	0.8	old

0.7	0.7	
0.7	0.7	I
0.7	1	turned
0.2	0.4	round
0.3	0.4	from
0.7	0.7	eyeing
0.6	0.7	the
0.3	0.3	bed,
0.2	0.2	but
0.3	0.4	he
0.5	0.9	had
0.7	0.8	disappeared.
0.9	0	
0.8	0.3	Folding
0.5	0.7	back
0.3	0.5	the

1	1	I
0.4	0.7	stooped
0.4	0	over

0.4	0.1	
0.7	0	Though

0.9	0.8	tolerably
0.2	0.3	well.
0.1	0.8	
0.4	0.6	I
1	0.5	then
0.4	0.3	glanced

0.1	0.5	the

0.8	0.8	
0.7	0.2	Likewise,

0.1	0.1	this
0.8	0.9	on
0.6	0.4	the

0.7	0	
0.3	1	I
0.9	0.7	took
0.4	0.9	it
0.3	0.3	up,
0.8	0.1	and
0.6	0.5	held
0.5	0.7	it
0.7	0.3	close
0.4	0.4	to
0.3	0.5	the
0.1	1	light,
0.6	1	and
0.3	0.6	felt

0.5	0.2	and
0.8	0.1	smelt
0.6	0.3	it,
0.4	0.7	and
0.1	0.5	tried
0.5	0	every

0.1	0.9	possible
0.7	0.2	to

0.6	0.2	conclusion
0.8	0.3	concerning
0.7	0.9	it.
0.6	0.3	
0.9	0.1	I
0.6	1	can
0.9	0	compare
0.9	0.8	it
0.5	0.7	to
0.3	0.7	nothing
1	0.3	but
0.7	0.7	a
0.1	1	large
0.6	0.8	door
0.5	0.1	mat,
0.2	0.8	ornamented
0.9	0.3	at

0.8	0.5	with
0	0	little
0.6	0.2	tinkling
0.4	0.5	tags
0.2	0.1	something

0.6	0.9	quills
0.7	0.9	round
0.8	0.9	an

0.6	0.7	
0.8	0.1	There
0.3	0.8	was
0.8	0.2	a

0.7	0.1	or

0.6	0.5	in
0.4	0.1	the

0	0	
1	0.5	But
0.1	0.2	could
0.3	0.9	it
0.6	0.9	be
0	0.9	possible
0.8	0.2	that
0.3	0.6	any

0.7	0.9	would
0.9	0.1	get
0.7	0.7	into

0.9	0.2	mat,
0.8	0.3	and

0.9	0.8	that
0	0.8	sort
0.7	0.3	of
0.8	0.6	guise?
0.5	0	I
0.6	0.3	put
1	0.9	it
0.6	0.4	on,
0	0.7	to
0.2	0.3	try
0.6	0	it,
0.2	0.6	and
0.8	0.1	it
0.2	0.1	weighed
0.3	0.4	me
0.7	0.9	down
0.7	1	like
0.9	0.5	a
0.7	0	hamper,
0.3	0.1	being
0.5	0.9	uncommonly
0.7	0.2	shaggy
0.6	0.3	and
0.7	0.9	thick,
0	0.1	and
0.8	0.1	I
0.4	0.7	thought
0.3	0.9	a
0.8	0.3	little
0.6	0	damp,
0.8	0.4	as
0.1	0.9	though
0.2	0.6	this
0.6	0.1	mysterious
0.1	0.4	harpooneer
0.1	0.7	had

0.3	0.7	wearing
0.7	0.8	it
0	0.6	of
0.2	0.8	a
0.1	0.6	rainy
0.6	0.2	day.
0.8	0.4	
0	0.9	I
0.9	0.4	went
0.8	0.9	up
0	0.7	in
0.3	0.2	it
0.2	0.5	to
0.3	0.4	a
0.9	0.9	bit
0.1	0.6	of
1	0.6	glass
0.1	0.3	stuck
0.3	0.7	against
0.7	0.5	the
0.2	0.2	wall,
0.2	0.4	and
0.4	0.1	I
0.7	0.9	never
0.3	0.5	saw
0.9	0.1	such
0.7	0.4	a
0.8	0.2	sight
0.2	0.8	in
0.6	0.4	my
0.2	0.1	life.
0.1	0.3	
0.1	0.9	I
0.3	0.3	tore
0.1	0.3	myself
0.7	0	out
0.2	0.1	of
0.8	0.4	it
0.7	0.7	in
0.1	0.8	such
0.9	0	a
0.8	0.8	hurry
0.3	0.5	that
0.5	0.8	I
0.7	0.6	gave
0.3	0.4	myself
0.9	0.3	a
0.6	0.1	kink
0.3	0	in
0.3	0.5	the
0.1	0.7	neck.
0.6	0.5	
0.8	0.7	I
0.6	0.5	sat
0.3	0.1	down
0.1	0.5	on
0.4	0.5	the
0.4	0.2	side
0.7	0.2	of
0.1	0.7	the
0.3	0	bed,
0	0.5	and
0.1	1	commenced
0.6	0.3	thinking
0.8	0	about
0	0.6	this
0.1	0.1	head-peddling
0.4	0.5	harpooneer,
0.2	0.2	and
0.5	0.3	his
0.8	0.5	door
0.6	1	mat.
0.1	0.7	
0.7	0.6	After
0.4	0.4	thinking
0.3	0.5	some
0.3	0.5	time
0.6	0.2	on
0.3	0.1	the
0.3	0.2	bed-side,
0	0.1	I
0	0.3	got
0.1	0.6	up
0.9	0.8	and
0.9	0.2	took
0.3	0.9	off
0.2	0.4	my
0.7	0.4	monkey
0.4	0.1	jacket,
0.6	0.6	and
0.2	0.9	then
0.5	0.1	stood
0.1	0.9	in
0.1	0.5	the
0.3	0.5	middle
0.4	0.7	of
0.3	0.9	the
0.3	0.5	room
0.3	0.3	thinking.
0.5	0.2	
0.2	0.8	I
0.1	0.7	then
0.9	0.7	took
0.6	0.5	off
0.8	1	my
0.8	0.6	coat,
0.9	0	and
0.4	0.5	thought
1	0.2	a
0.9	1	little
0.4	0	more
0.8	0.9	in
0.2	0.2	my
0.3	0.6	shirt
0.6	0.6	sleeves.
0.5	0.8	
0.3	0.4	But
0.4	0.7	beginning
0.8	0.2	to
0.8	0.9	feel
0.3	0.9	very
0.4	0.8	cold
0	0.7	now,
0.1	0.4	half
0.4	0.3	undressed
0.9	0	as
0.1	0.3	I
0.8	0.5	was,
0.1	0.2	and
0.8	0.8	remembering
0.3	0.3	what
1	0.8	the
0.3	0.2	landlord
0.1	0.1	said
0.7	0.8	about
0.3	0.5	the
0.9	0.4	harpooneer's
0.7	0.9	not
0.1	0.1	coming
0.9	0.5	home
0.7	0.8	at
0.9	0.8	all
0.4	0.2	that
0.7	0.3	night,
0.6	0.4	it
0.9	0.5	being
0.2	0.4	so
0.2	0.3	very
0.2	0.8	late,
0.8	0.9	I
0.4	0.8	made
1	0.2	no
0.5	0.1	more
0.2	0.9	ado,
0.2	0.1	but
0.7	0.3	jumped
0.2	0.7	out
0.9	0.5	of
1	0.5	my
0.8	0.1	pantaloons
0.1	1	and
0.3	0.4	boots,
0.9	0	and
0.1	0.4	then
0.2	0.6	blowing
0.6	0.5	out
0.4	0.1	the
0.3	0.2	light
0.3	0.4	tumbled
0.6	0.3	into
0.1	0.8	bed,
0.3	0.4	and
0.1	0.4	commended
0.2	0	myself
0.1	0.1	to

0.5	0.8	of

0.1	0.9	
0.8	0.7	Whether
1	0.4	that
1	0.6	mattress
0.3	0.9	was
0.8	0.1	stuffed

0.2	0.5	or

0.2	0.4	crockery,
0.9	0.6	there
0.1	0.8	is
0.3	0	no
0.2	0.5	telling,
0.3	0.7	but
0.9	0.5	I
0.4	0.1	rolled
0.2	0.6	about
0.1	0.8	a
0.2	0.3	good
0.3	0.2	deal,
0.6	0.8	and
0.7	0.7	could
0.9	0.8	not
0.6	0.2	sleep
0.8	0.6	for
0.7	0.9	a
0.9	0.5	long
0.6	0.8	time.
0.6	0.3	
0.9	0.4	At
0.9	0	last
0.5	0	I
0.3	0.6	slid
0.9	0.7	off
0.6	0.8	into
0.6	0.4	a
0.4	0.1	light
0.7	0.6	doze,
0.8	0.7	and
0.5	0.9	had

0.6	0	when
0.3	0.1	I

0.5	0	in
0.7	0.1	the
0.7	0.9	passage,
0.3	0.2	and
0.1	0.7	saw

0.8	0.3	come
0.3	0.7	into

0.1	0.6	
0.7	0	Lord
0.9	0.3	save
0.5	0.2	me,
0.3	0.1	thinks
0.7	0.6	I,
1	0.5	that
0.7	0.9	must
0.3	0.4	be
0.3	0.5	the
0.9	0.4	harpooneer,
0.8	0.4	the
0.4	0.6	infernal
0.7	0.4	head-peddler.
0	0.2	
0.8	0.3	But
1	0.7	I

0.1	0.8	resolved
0.6	0.4	not
0.6	0.9	to
0.3	0.8	say
0.3	0.3	a
0.3	0.2	word
1	0.7	till
0.1	0.9	spoken
0.7	0.3	to.
0.5	0.8	
0.6	0.9	Holding
0.3	0.3	a
0.8	0.8	light
0.8	0.3	in
0.3	0.6	one
0	0.3	hand,
0.6	0.6	and

0.3	0.3	head
0.4	0.8	in
0.6	0	the
0.6	0.6	other,
0.5	0.2	the
0.7	0.2	stranger
0.2	0.1	entered
0.3	0.8	the
0.3	1	room,
0.6	0.7	and
0.8	0.7	without
0.6	0.8	looking
0.8	0.4	towards
0.1	0.3	the
0.3	1	bed,
0.6	0.9	placed
0.9	0.9	his
0.1	0.2	candle
0.4	0.3	a
0.8	0.3	good
0.4	0.2	way
0.1	0.6	off
0.5	0.7	from
0.9	0.6	me
0.3	0.2	on
0.4	0.1	the
0.3	0.3	floor
0.4	0.3	in
0.6	0.7	one
1	0.7	corner,
0.1	0.8	and
0.2	0.2	then
0.5	1	began
1	0.1	working
0.5	0.7	away
0.1	0	at
0.5	0.7	the
0.5	0.5	knotted
0.5	0.1	cords
0.3	0.6	of
0.4	0.7	the
0.3	0.5	large
0.2	0.1	bag
0.8	0.9	I
0.8	0.6	before
0.6	0.6	spoke
0.8	0.1	of
0.9	0.4	as
0.5	0	being
0.9	0.6	in
0.7	0.2	the
0.9	0.5	room.
0.6	0.5	
0.2	0.2	I
0.6	0.3	was
0.7	0.2	all
0.8	0.8	eagerness
0.6	0.1	to
0.2	0.1	see
0.2	0.7	his
0.1	0.5	face,
0.5	0.1	but
0.3	0	he
0.8	0.9	kept
0	0.3	it
0.7	0.1	averted
0.3	0.8	for
0.6	0.7	some
0.8	0.3	time
0.6	0.9	while
0.9	0.6	employed
0.3	0.2	in
0.7	0.5	unlacing
0.2	0.2	the
0.3	0.4	bag's
1	0.5	mouth.
0.4	0.2	
0.9	0.8	This
0.9	0.5	accomplished,
0.4	0.9	however,
0	1	he
0.8	0.3	turned
0.8	0.8	round--when,
0.3	0.1	good
0.5	0.6	heavens!
0.7	0.7	what
0.9	0	a
0.1	0.6	sight!
0	0.3	
0.1	0.3	Such
0.5	0.9	a
0.1	0.5	face!
0.6	0.5	
0.8	0	It
0.4	0.6	was
0.7	0.7	of
0.3	0.4	a
0.3	0.6	dark,
0.1	0.9	purplish,
0.1	0.2	yellow
0.2	0.7	colour,
0.8	0.9	here
0	0	and
0.6	0.3	there
0.7	1	stuck
0.7	0.4	over
1	0.8	with
0.5	0.8	large
0.1	0.6	blackish
0.8	1	looking
0.2	0.8	squares.
0.3	0.8	
0.7	0.4	Yes,
0.3	0.6	it's
0.6	0.3	just
0.1	0.9	as
0.4	0.3	I
0.8	0.7	thought,
0.3	0.4	he's
0.4	0.3	a
0	1	terrible
0.9	0.4	bedfellow;
0.4	1	he's
0.1	0.9	been
0.6	0.5	in
0.8	0.4	a
0.3	0.4	fight,
0.5	0.7	got
0.5	1	dreadfully
0.6	0.6	cut,
0.7	0.8	and
0.7	0.9	here
0.7	0.4	he
0.9	0.8	is,
0.5	0.4	just
0.4	0.3	from
1	0.1	the
0.5	0.9	surgeon.
0.4	0.5	
0.2	0.5	But
0.5	0.4	at
0.3	0.2	that
0.8	0.7	moment
0.5	0.2	he
0.8	0.7	chanced
0.2	0.4	to
0.5	0.1	turn
0.3	0.4	his
0.3	0.4	face
0.1	0.2	so
0.4	0.7	towards
1	0.6	the
0.1	0.3	light,
0.7	0.8	that
0.4	0.9	I
0.2	0.3	plainly
0.5	0.3	saw
0.2	1	they
0.3	0.6	could
0.3	0.5	not
0.8	0.9	be
0.6	0.6	sticking-plasters
0.8	0.3	at
0.5	0.1	all,
0.5	0.9	those
0.7	0.7	black
0.3	0.6	squares
0.3	0.5	on
0.7	0	his
0.8	0.7	cheeks.
0.9	0.8	
0.7	0.6	They
0.8	0.9	were
0.4	0.4	stains
0.4	0.3	of
0.9	0.1	some
0.2	0.5	sort
0	0.5	or
0.1	0.3	other.
0.9	0.6	
1	0.4	At
0.3	0.6	first
0.2	0.9	I
0.5	0.1	knew
0.9	0.2	not
0.5	0.4	what
0.4	0.6	to
0.9	0.7	make
0.5	0.6	of
0.7	0.7	this;
0.1	1	but
0.7	0.8	soon
0.4	0.6	an
0.1	0.3	inkling
0.5	0	of
0.4	0.9	the
0.9	1	truth
0.8	0.5	occurred
0.2	0.7	to
0.6	0.3	me.
0.9	0.6	
0.9	0.8	I
0.2	0.6	remembered
0.1	0.3	a
1	0.3	story
1	0.4	of
0.1	0.4	a
0.8	0.3	white
0.8	0.3	man--a
0.5	0.8	whaleman
0.1	0.6	too--who,
0.5	0.6	falling
0.3	0.2	among
0.6	0.7	the
0.6	0.9	cannibals,
0.3	0.4	had
0.6	0.7	been
0.4	0.3	tattooed
0.4	0.3	by
0.8	0.9	them.
0.9	0.4	
0.9	0.5	I
0.3	0.3	concluded
0.7	0.3	that
0.2	0.3	this
0.1	0.1	harpooneer,
0.7	0.1	in
0.4	0.6	the
0.5	0.2	course
1	0.9	of
0.3	0.6	his
0.8	0.8	distant
0.2	0.5	voyages,
0.8	0.8	must
0.1	0.6	have
0.3	0.5	met
0.3	0.7	with
0.3	0.8	a
0.5	0.8	similar
0.6	0.4	adventure.
0.6	0.8	
0.8	0.7	And
0.7	0.3	what
1	0.7	is
0.3	0.5	it,
0.1	0.1	thought
0.7	0.8	I,
0.4	0.3	after
0.6	0.7	all!
0.4	0.2	
0.3	0.8	It's
0.7	0.8	only
0.8	0.2	his
0.7	0.8	outside;
0.4	0.7	a
0.4	0.4	man
0	0.5	can
0.3	0.9	be
0.7	0.3	honest
0.5	0.3	in
0.2	0.5	any
0.6	0.7	sort
0	0.3	of
0.1	0.1	skin.
0.5	0.2	
0.3	0.2	But
0.9	0.4	then,
0.3	0.5	what
0.1	0.9	to
0.4	0.1	make
0.3	0	of
0.4	0.7	his
0.4	0.6	unearthly
0.6	0.8	complexion,
0.1	0.3	that
0.8	0.1	part
0.4	0.7	of
0.9	0.3	it,
0.7	0.1	I
0.6	0.3	mean,
0.3	0.4	lying
0.4	0.7	round
0.7	0.3	about,
0.7	0.5	and
0.7	0.1	completely
0.6	0.7	independent
0.4	0.5	of
0.3	0.6	the
0.7	0.9	squares
0.7	0.3	of
0.7	0.7	tattooing.
0.6	0.5	
0.3	0.3	To
0.6	0.9	be
0.4	0.1	sure,
0.1	0.2	it
0.5	0.8	might
0.6	0.4	be
0.9	0.7	nothing
0	0.6	but
0.8	0.4	a
0.5	0.7	good
0.5	0.1	coat
0.4	0.9	of
0	0.1	tropical
0.8	0.5	tanning;
0.4	0.7	but
0.2	0.7	I
0.9	0.1	never
0.3	0.5	heard
1	0.4	of
0.6	0.7	a
0.6	0.6	hot
0.5	0.4	sun's
0.7	0.8	tanning
0.7	0.2	a
0.3	1	white
1	0.8	man
0.6	0.5	into
0.3	0.9	a
0.4	0.9	purplish
0.3	0.2	yellow
0.4	0.5	one.
0.5	0.9	However,
0.3	0.2	I
0.9	0.6	had
0.8	0.9	never
0.5	0.3	been
0.3	0.6	in
0.3	0.6	the
0	0.4	South
0.8	0.5	Seas;
0.9	0.5	and
0.2	0.7	perhaps
0.1	0.9	the
0.3	0.2	sun
0.7	0	there
0.2	0.8	produced
0.9	0.6	these
0.5	0.7	extraordinary
0.5	0.8	effects
0.2	0.6	upon
0.1	0.9	the
0.7	0.8	skin.
0.9	0.3	
0.4	0.8	Now,
0.7	0.8	while
0.4	0.3	all
0.6	1	these
0.2	0.2	ideas
0.9	0.7	were
0.3	0.6	passing
0.1	0.2	through
0.3	0.2	me
0.6	0.6	like
0.5	0.2	lightning,
0.5	0.9	this
0.9	0.1	harpooneer
0.4	0.4	never
0	1	noticed
0.7	0.3	me
1	0.5	at
0.7	1	all.
0.5	0.2	
0	0.8	But,
0.9	0.9	after
0.4	0.4	some
0.3	1	difficulty
0.7	0.6	having
0.2	0.1	opened
0.4	0.6	his
0.2	0	bag,
0.2	0	he
0.4	0.3	commenced
0.2	0.8	fumbling
0.6	0.2	in
0.5	0.9	it,
0.6	0.1	and
0.8	0.3	presently
0.8	0.8	pulled
0.2	0.6	out
1	0.9	a
0	0.4	sort
0.9	0.9	of
0.3	0.4	tomahawk,
0.1	0.4	and
0.5	0.8	a
0.2	0.8	seal-skin
0.4	0.6	wallet
0.5	0.6	with
0.3	0.5	the
0.1	0.3	hair
0.1	0.8	on.
0.2	0.5	
0.4	0	Placing
0.4	0.5	these
0.7	0.2	on
0.6	0.4	the
0.3	0	old
0.4	0.7	chest
0.9	0.7	in
0.5	0.4	the
0.1	0.1	middle
0.1	0.5	of
0.2	0.8	the
0.7	0.1	room,
0.1	0.1	he
1	0.8	then
0.3	0.8	took
0.9	0.5	the
0.6	0.1	New
0	0.8	Zealand
0.1	0.6	head--a
0	0.4	ghastly
0.6	0.1	thing
0.4	0.2	enough--and
0.3	0.5	crammed
0.2	0.2	it
0.9	0.8	down
1	0.3	into
0.3	0.8	the
0.9	0.5	bag.
0.3	0.7	
0.8	0.9	He
0.2	0.3	now
0.5	0.1	took
0.8	0.2	off
0.7	0.1	his
0.5	0.9	hat--a
0.9	0.8	new
0.1	0.1	beaver
0.9	0.3	hat--when
0.4	0.4	I
0.9	0.1	came
0.7	0.3	nigh
0.6	0.7	singing
0.3	0.3	out
1	0.4	with
0.7	0	fresh
0.3	0.8	surprise.
0.5	0.7	
0.5	0.3	There
0.4	0.6	was
0.6	0.4	no
0.5	0.6	hair
0.5	0.9	on
0.9	0.6	his
0.6	0.1	head--none
0.8	0.4	to
0.2	0.5	speak
0.1	0.3	of
1	0.5	at
0.1	0.9	least--nothing
0.3	0.3	but
0.8	0.1	a
0.3	0.3	small
0.4	0.8	scalp-knot
0.5	0.6	twisted
0.2	0.7	up
0.6	0.4	on
0.6	0.2	his
0.2	0.1	forehead.
0.8	0.7	
0.6	0.3	His
1	0.6	bald
0.7	0.6	purplish
0.8	0.2	head
0.4	0.1	now
0.8	0.6	looked
0.5	0.3	for
0.8	0.7	all
0.3	0.1	the
1	0.9	world
0.5	0.3	like
0.5	0.1	a
0.8	0.3	mildewed
0.6	0.4	skull.
0.2	0.5	
0.7	0.9	Had
0.1	1	not
1	0.8	the
0.6	0.3	stranger
0.3	0.4	stood
0.2	0.2	between
0.8	0.8	me
0.3	0.5	and
0.8	0.6	the
0.4	0.8	door,
0.6	0.8	I
0.1	0.1	would
1	0	have
0.1	0.2	bolted
0.8	0.2	out
0.5	0.1	of
0.5	0.8	it
0.4	0.5	quicker
0.1	0.5	than
0.3	0.9	ever
0.2	0.4	I
0.3	0.7	bolted
0.9	0.8	a
0.2	0.2	dinner.
0.6	0.8	
0.1	0.4	Even
0.7	0.2	as
0	0.6	it
1	0.3	was,
0.1	1	I
0.9	0.2	thought
1	0.8	something
0.1	0.7	of
0.8	0.8	slipping
0.9	0.8	out
0.9	0.8	of
0.1	0.3	the
0.6	0.5	window,
0.7	0.9	but
0.8	0.9	it
0.1	0.6	was
0.3	0.3	the
0.1	0.9	second
0.5	0.8	floor
0.5	0.1	back.
0.9	0.8	
0.7	0.8	I
0.5	0.3	am
0.5	0.6	no
0.2	0.8	coward,
0.3	0.5	but
0.8	0.6	what
0.1	0.8	to
1	0.7	make
0.8	0.1	of
0.4	0.9	this
0.2	0.8	head-peddling
0.2	0.1	purple
0.3	0.7	rascal
0.3	0.6	altogether
0.6	0.8	passed
1	0.1	my
0.7	1	comprehension.
0.4	0.6	
0.4	0.3	Ignorance
0.7	0.1	is
0.3	0.8	the
0.5	0.5	parent
1	0.8	of
0	0.2	fear,
0.9	0.8	and
0.2	0.6	being
0.6	0.9	completely
0.3	0.7	nonplussed
0.2	0.3	and
0.3	0.6	confounded
0.5	0	about
0.7	0.4	the
1	0.2	stranger,
0.9	0.1	I
0.8	0.4	confess
0.5	0.1	I
0	0.3	was
0.1	0.6	now
0.1	0.1	as
0.9	0.2	much
0.6	0.9	afraid
0.7	0.5	of
0.3	0.3	him
0.4	1	as
0.3	0.1	if
0.6	0.7	it
0.3	0.9	was
1	0.5	the
0.8	0.5	devil
0.1	0.9	himself
0.9	0.4	who
0.7	0	had
1	0.3	thus
0.7	0.6	broken
0.4	0.4	into
0.4	0.4	my
0.1	0.3	room
0.1	0.8	at
0.5	0.4	the
0.2	0.9	dead
0.8	1	of
0.8	0.3	night.
0.7	0.6	
0.6	1	In
0.9	0.9	fact,
0.7	0.4	I
0.3	0.7	was
0.8	0.1	so
0.6	0.4	afraid
0.8	0.8	of
0.7	0.9	him
0.1	0.5	that
0.9	0.4	I
0.6	0.6	was
0.4	0.8	not
0.3	0.2	game
0.1	0.6	enough
1	1	just
0.1	0.3	then
0	0.7	to
0.3	0.3	address
0.2	0.4	him,
0.4	0	and
1	0.8	demand
0.4	0.6	a
0.8	0.6	satisfactory
0	0.3	answer
0.8	0.3	concerning
0.5	0.8	what
0.1	0.7	seemed
0.2	0.9	inexplicable
0.3	0.5	in
0.1	0.6	him.
0.5	0.4	
0.7	0.7	Meanwhile,
0.5	0.1	he
0.8	0.4	continued
0.1	0.8	the
0.5	0	business
0.6	0.7	of
0.9	0.5	undressing,
0.5	0.1	and
0.4	0.9	at
0.8	0.5	last
0.4	0.6	showed
0.3	0.4	his
0.7	0.4	chest
0.4	0.9	and
0.6	0	arms.
0.4	0.6	
0.8	0.3	As
0.5	0.2	I
0.2	0.6	live,
0.7	0.1	these
0.6	0.7	covered
1	0.9	parts
0.8	0.2	of
0.2	0.1	him
0.7	0.7	were
0.2	0.5	checkered
0.1	0.6	with
0.9	0	the
0.2	0.9	same
0.5	1	squares
0.8	0.9	as
0.2	0.5	his
0.9	0.6	face;
0.1	0.4	his
0.9	0.1	back,
0.4	0.5	too,
0.4	0.1	was
0.3	0.8	all
0.5	0.3	over
0.9	0.7	the
0.3	0.6	same
0.1	0.3	dark
0.2	0.8	squares;
0.7	0.6	he
1	0.5	seemed
0.1	0.6	to
0.1	0.9	have
0.3	0.7	been
0.1	0.2	in
0.1	0	a
0.1	0.2	Thirty
0.2	0.9	Years'
0.6	0.2	War,
0.5	0.6	and
0.9	0.5	just
0.9	0.3	escaped
0.2	1	from
0.6	1	it
0.7	0.2	with
0.9	0.1	a
0.3	0.8	sticking-plaster
0.2	0.1	shirt.
0.6	0.1	Still
0.1	0.7	more,
0.8	0.9	his
0.3	0.9	very
0.1	0.5	legs
0.9	0.8	were
0.5	0.2	marked,
0.6	0.2	as
0.3	0.9	if
0	1	a
0.1	0.3	parcel
0.2	0.6	of
0.1	0.5	dark
0.9	0.4	green
0.8	0.3	frogs
0.1	0.8	were
0.3	0.4	running
0.9	0.7	up
0	0.1	the
0.4	0.8	trunks
0.6	0.2	of
0.4	0.4	young
0.5	0.2	palms.
0.2	0.8	
0.3	0.1	It
0.1	0.4	was
0.5	0.2	now
0.2	0.5	quite
0.2	0.2	plain
0.8	0.1	that
0.6	0.6	he
1	0.2	must
0.4	0.9	be
1	0	some
0	0.6	abominable
0	0.1	savage
0.2	0.3	or
0.3	0.6	other
0.8	0.9	shipped
0	0.4	aboard
0.7	0.4	of
0.1	0	a
0.1	0.7	whaleman
0.1	0.4	in
0.1	0.9	the
1	0.5	South
1	0.6	Seas,
0.2	0.4	and
0.5	0.9	so
0.1	0.5	landed
0.1	0.4	in
0	0.6	this
0.5	0.8	Christian
0.6	0.6	country.
0.7	0.2	
0.1	0.8	I
0.6	0.7	quaked
0.9	0.7	to
0.7	0.6	think
0.7	0.2	of
0.4	0.8	it.
0.9	0.8	
0.3	0.8	A
0.3	0.1	peddler
0.9	0.6	of
0.9	0	heads
0.4	0.4	too--perhaps
0	0.7	the
0.8	0.3	heads
0.8	0.4	of
0.9	0.9	his
0.7	0	own
0.1	1	brothers.
0.7	0.1	
0.9	0.6	He
0.4	0.6	might
0.9	0.8	take
0.1	0.4	a
0.8	0.1	fancy
0.5	0.4	to
0.1	0.5	mine--heavens!
0.1	0.8	look
1	0.1	at
0.9	0.1	that
0.8	0.3	tomahawk!
0.6	0.7	
0.5	0.9	But
0.4	0.7	there
0.4	0.9	was
0.9	0.2	no
0.5	1	time
0.9	0.1	for
0	0.4	shuddering,
0.8	0.7	for
0.9	0.1	now
0.9	0.8	the
0.8	0.3	savage
0.8	0.1	went
0.8	0.3	about
0.4	0.2	something
0.9	0.7	that
0.3	0.3	completely
0.7	0.6	fascinated
0.3	0.4	my
0.4	0.5	attention,
0.9	0.4	and
0.8	0.3	convinced
0.4	0.9	me
0.9	0.9	that
0.8	0.7	he
0.3	0.9	must
0.1	0.3	indeed
0.9	0.2	be
0.6	0.8	a
0.9	0.1	heathen.
0.1	0.6	
0.4	0.4	Going
0.4	0.2	to
0.8	0	his
0.4	0.8	heavy
0.7	0.8	grego,
0.8	0.7	or
0.8	0.2	wrapall,
0	0.6	or
0.6	0.2	dreadnaught,
0.9	0.6	which
0	0.8	he
0.3	0.3	had
0.5	0.4	previously
0.5	0.8	hung
1	0.1	on
0.7	0.5	a
0.3	0.4	chair,
0.6	0.5	he
0.8	0.3	fumbled
1	1	in
0.7	1	the
0.9	0.7	pockets,
0.6	0.2	and
0.5	0.6	produced
0.5	0.5	at
0.1	0.9	length
0.5	0.2	a
0.9	0.2	curious
0.2	0.6	little
0.3	0.2	deformed
0.5	0.6	image
0.8	0.8	with
0	0.6	a
0.6	0.1	hunch
0.5	0	on
0.8	0.4	its
0.5	0.1	back,
0.6	0.9	and
0.7	0.9	exactly
0.8	0.5	the
0.1	0.2	colour
0	0.6	of
0.6	0.3	a
0.2	0.8	three
0.9	0.6	days'
0.6	0.5	old
0.4	0	Congo
0.5	0.3	baby.
0.6	1	
0	0.6	Remembering
0.3	0.1	the
1	0.7	embalmed
0.8	0.9	head,
0.5	0.7	at
0.5	0.2	first
0.9	0.1	I
0.7	0.4	almost
0.7	0.7	thought
0.9	0	that
0.1	1	this
0.5	0.2	black
0.6	0.7	manikin
0.8	0.5	was
0.9	0.3	a
0.5	0.2	real
0.4	0	baby
0.4	0	preserved
0.7	0.9	in
0.5	0.1	some
0.6	1	similar
0.5	0.4	manner.
0.4	0.8	
0.6	0.3	But
0.6	0.8	seeing
0.2	0.1	that
0.8	0.2	it
0.7	0.9	was
0.3	0.2	not
0.1	0	at
0.5	0.1	all
0.6	0	limber,
0.4	0.8	and
0.5	0.3	that
0.1	0.3	it
0	0	glistened
0.2	0.8	a
0.9	0.3	good
0.1	0.4	deal
0.2	0.3	like
0.7	0.2	polished
0.4	0.7	ebony,
0.4	0.7	I
0.7	0.2	concluded
0.2	0.8	that
0.1	0.9	it
0.9	0.9	must
0.2	0.1	be
0.1	0.7	nothing
0.2	0.1	but
0.4	1	a
0.6	0.9	wooden
0	0.6	idol,
0.2	0.1	which
0.5	0.2	indeed
0.1	0.3	it
0.8	0.4	proved
0.5	0.9	to
0.7	0.5	be.
0.5	0.8	
0.2	0.1	For
0.5	0.8	now
0.8	0.5	the
0.1	1	savage
0.9	0.3	goes
0.5	0.2	up
0.5	1	to
0.4	0.2	the
0.4	0.9	empty
1	0.5	fire-place,
0.5	0.3	and
0.8	0.2	removing
0.7	0.4	the
0.9	0.5	papered
0.8	0.7	fire-board,
0.8	0	sets
0.3	0.8	up
0.7	0.7	this
0.6	0.3	little
0.1	0.4	hunch-backed
1	0.1	image,
0.1	0.1	like
0.6	0.3	a
0.1	0.1	tenpin,
0.3	0.6	between
0.6	0.6	the
0.7	0.2	andirons.
1	0.3	
0.8	0.1	The
0.3	0.6	chimney
1	0.7	jambs
0.5	0.4	and
0.4	0	all
0.4	0	the
0.7	0.2	bricks
0.5	0.9	inside
0	0.2	were
0.4	0.5	very
0.4	0.9	sooty,
0.3	0.7	so
1	0.9	that
0.3	0.3	I
0.5	1	thought
0.6	0	this
0.3	0.2	fire-place
0.7	0.7	made
0.2	0.7	a
0.4	0.7	very
0.3	0.6	appropriate
0.4	0.2	little
0.1	0.7	shrine
0.2	0.9	or
0.1	0.9	chapel
0.3	0.5	for
0.7	0.5	his
0.6	0.4	Congo
0.6	0.6	idol.
0.4	0.9	
0.1	0.4	I
0.8	0.6	now
0.7	0.1	screwed
0.2	0.8	my
0.6	0.5	eyes
0.6	0.4	hard
0.6	0.9	towards
0.3	0.1	the
0.7	0.8	half
0.3	0.8	hidden
0.3	1	image,
0	0.3	feeling
0.8	0.8	but
0.2	0.2	ill
0.2	0.6	at
0.5	0.7	ease
0.6	0.7	meantime--to
0.6	0.6	see
0.7	0.5	what
0.7	0.2	was
0	0.2	next
0	0.3	to
0.5	0.6	follow.
0.3	0.6	
0.9	0.6	First
0.4	0.5	he
0.2	0.8	takes
0.4	0.3	about
0.3	0.3	a
0.5	0.8	double
0.2	0.4	handful
0.3	0.3	of
0.2	0	shavings
1	0.1	out
1	0.6	of
0.5	0.6	his
0.9	0.2	grego
0.7	0.4	pocket,
0.6	0.1	and
0.8	0.6	places
0.4	0.2	them
0.3	0.9	carefully
0.3	0.7	before
0.3	0.4	the
0.3	0.6	idol;
0.6	0.3	then
0.4	0.7	laying
0.8	0	a
0.8	0.8	bit
0.6	0.5	of
0.2	0.7	ship
0.3	0.8	biscuit
0.3	0.1	on
0.1	1	top
0.4	0.5	and
0	0.8	applying
0.1	0.3	the
0.9	0.5	flame
0.2	1	from
0.8	0.3	the
0.2	0.2	lamp,
1	0.6	he
0.9	0.4	kindled
0.9	0.2	the
0	0	shavings
0.1	0.3	into
0	0.2	a
0.9	0.2	sacrificial
0.1	0.4	blaze.
0.6	0.2	
0.4	0	Presently,
0.3	0.5	after
0.8	0.3	many
0.2	0.1	hasty
0.6	0	snatches
0.6	0.8	into
0.2	0.8	the
0.7	1	fire,
0.5	0.7	and
0.7	0.6	still
0.3	0.5	hastier
0.4	0.6	withdrawals
0.1	0.6	of
0.8	0.7	his
0.3	0.1	fingers
0.6	0.8	(whereby
0.7	0	he
0.6	0.3	seemed
0.8	0.9	to
0.8	0.9	be
0.3	0.7	scorching
0.7	0.3	them
0.9	0	badly),
0.1	0.8	he
0.8	0.5	at
0.4	0.1	last
0.8	0.3	succeeded
0.3	0.3	in
0.8	0.2	drawing
0.2	0.4	out
0.8	0.8	the
0.3	0.4	biscuit;
0	0.7	then
0.1	0.2	blowing
0.8	0.6	off
0.7	0.9	the
0.4	0.6	heat
0.6	0.2	and
0.3	0.1	ashes
0.9	0.1	a
0.9	0.6	little,
1	0.1	he
0.7	0.3	made
0.7	0.2	a
0.4	0.5	polite
0	0.6	offer
0.6	0.5	of
0.9	0.8	it
0.2	0	to
0.9	0.6	the
0.7	0.2	little
0.7	0.1	negro.
0.2	0.8	
0.4	0.7	But
1	0.8	the
0.9	0.6	little
0.3	0.1	devil
0.2	0.2	did
0.7	0.1	not
0.9	0	seem
0.7	0.9	to
0.9	0.6	fancy
0.5	0.3	such
0.3	0.6	dry
0.1	0.4	sort
0.8	0.4	of
0.6	0.2	fare
0.1	0.2	at
0.6	0.9	all;
0.9	0.1	he
0.2	0.8	never
0.2	0.2	moved
0.1	0.5	his
0.4	0.5	lips.
0.2	0.7	
0.4	0.3	All
0.6	0.5	these
0.5	0.7	strange
0.1	0.7	antics
0	0.9	were
0.7	0.9	accompanied
0.3	0.6	by
0.1	0.9	still
0.9	0.3	stranger
0.1	0.5	guttural
0.6	0	noises
0.8	0.1	from
0.1	0.5	the
0.2	0	devotee,
0.2	0.3	who
0.5	0.9	seemed
0.4	0.1	to
0.3	0.9	be
0.6	0.2	praying
0.1	0.3	in
0.5	0.8	a
0.6	0.6	sing-song
0.1	0.9	or
0.5	0.6	else
0.3	0.7	singing
0.2	0.9	some
0.2	0.8	pagan
0	0.2	psalmody
0.5	0.8	or
0.2	0.4	other,
0.3	0.3	during
0.6	0.7	which
0.7	0.8	his
0.7	1	face
0.7	0.5	twitched
0.5	0.3	about
0.5	0.9	in
0.8	0.1	the
1	0.9	most
0.8	0.5	unnatural
0.8	0.9	manner.
0.1	0.8	At
0.1	0	last
0.7	0.5	extinguishing
0.3	1	the
0.9	1	fire,
0.4	0.8	he
0.7	0	took
0.9	0.3	the
0.7	0.3	idol
0.3	0.7	up
0.5	0.6	very
0.5	0.2	unceremoniously,
1	0.6	and
0.9	0.3	bagged
0.6	0.7	it
0.3	0.7	again
0.8	0.5	in
0.7	0.6	his
0.1	0.7	grego
0.8	0	pocket
0.7	0.7	as
0.5	0.4	carelessly
0.2	0.5	as
1	0.3	if

0.6	0.8	were
0.6	0.2	a
0	0.2	sportsman
0.5	0.3	bagging
0.7	0.6	a

0.4	0.3	woodcock.
0.2	0.5	
0.7	0.4	All
0.9	0.3	these
0.6	0.3	queer
0.7	0.6	proceedings
0.4	0.8	increased
0.3	0.1	my
0.3	0.6	uncomfortableness,
0.1	0.2	and
0.8	0.3	seeing
0.5	0.3	him
0.7	0.8	now
0.9	0.5	exhibiting
0.9	0.8	strong
0.5	0.9	symptoms
0.2	0.7	of
0.2	0.9	concluding
0.7	0.6	his
0.8	0.4	business
0	0.5	operations,
0.5	0.6	and
0.5	0.6	jumping
0.6	0.2	into
0.8	0.8	bed
0.1	0.7	with
0.6	0.5	me,
0.5	0.9	I
0.7	0.2	thought
0.1	0.6	it
0.6	0.3	was
1	0.3	high
0	0.9	time,
0.6	0.5	now
1	0.8	or
0.9	0.6	never,
0.4	0	before
0.5	0.5	the
0.1	0.9	light
0.4	0.5	was
0.8	0.5	put
0	0.8	out,
0.4	0.6	to
0.6	0.6	break
0.3	0.4	the
0.9	0.9	spell
0.8	0.5	in
0.5	0.8	which
0.6	0.7	I
0.3	0.8	had
0.7	0.5	so
0.3	0.6	long
0.7	0.4	been
0	0	bound.
0.5	0.2	
0.5	0.8	But
0.4	0.4	the
0.6	0.5	interval
0.5	0.7	I
0.1	0	spent
0.3	0.9	in
0.5	0.1	deliberating
0.5	0.8	what
0.4	0.2	to
0.9	0	say,
0.8	0.7	was
0.7	0.7	a
0.3	0.1	fatal
0.3	0.2	one.
0.7	0.3	
0.5	0.9	Taking
0.7	0.2	up
0.1	0.9	his
0.1	0.5	tomahawk
0.9	0.8	from
0.1	0.2	the
0.1	0.4	table,
0.4	0.8	he
0.7	0.7	examined
1	0.2	the
0.1	0.6	head
0.1	0.4	of
0.5	0.9	it
0.7	0	for
0.6	0.2	an
0.6	0	instant,
0.5	0.6	and
0.9	0.8	then
0.1	0.5	holding
0.2	0.8	it
0.4	0.2	to
0.8	0.2	the
0.3	0.8	light,
0.1	0.1	with
0	0.5	his
0.7	0.8	mouth
0.3	0.9	at
0.8	0.1	the
0.3	0.1	handle,
1	0.5	he
0.4	0.7	puffed
0.9	1	out
0.8	0.8	great
0.7	0.2	clouds
0.5	0	of
0.1	0.7	tobacco
0.4	0.1	smoke.
0.6	0.7	
0.6	0.8	The
0.6	0.9	next
0.2	0.7	moment
0.5	0.3	the
0.8	0.4	light
0.2	0.8	was
0.3	0.5	extinguished,
0.3	0.8	and
0.9	0.7	this
0	0.3	wild
0.2	1	cannibal,
0	0.8	tomahawk
0.7	0.8	between
0.2	0	his

0.8	1	
0.4	0.9	I
0.7	0.9	sang
0.1	0.6	out,
0.8	0.2	I
0.3	0.3	could
0.6	0.5	not
0.6	0.2	help
0.2	1	it
0.3	0.8	now;
0.1	0.3	and
0.4	0.4	giving
0.7	0.4	a
0.2	0.1	sudden
0.6	0.1	grunt
0.7	0.9	of
0.5	0.8	astonishment
0.8	0.5	he
0.9	0.6	began

0.6	0.3	me.
0.2	1	
0.6	0.8	Stammering
0.9	0.9	out
0.9	0.7	something,
0.8	0.4	I
0	0.5	knew
0.5	0.2	not
0.7	0.7	what,
0.5	0.3	I
0.6	0.2	rolled
0.6	0.4	away
0.9	0.2	from
0.4	0.8	him
0.2	0.8	against
0.2	0.1	the

0.8	0.4	then

0.8	0	or
0.8	0.5	whatever
0.1	0.8	he
0.3	0.5	might

0.8	0.6	to
0.7	0.8	keep
0.8	0.3	quiet,
0.5	0.4	and
0.8	0.3	let
0.2	0.6	me
0.2	0.1	get
0.7	0.8	up
0.8	0.3	and
0.5	0.7	light
0.5	0.2	the

0.2	0.4	
0.6	0.9	But
0.9	0.1	his
0.9	0.7	guttural
0.2	0.5	responses
0.5	1	satisfied
0.5	0.3	me
0.6	0.7	at

0.3	0.1	that
0.4	0.5	he
0	0.2	but

0.8	0.1	
0.1	0.7	"Who-e

0.6	0.9	you?"--he
0.5	0.3	at

0.4	0.8	said--"you

0.2	0.8	
0.8	0.1	And
0.5	0.5	so
0.9	0	saying
0.3	0.7	the
0.2	0.7	lighted
0.1	0.3	tomahawk
0.1	0.4	began
0.9	0.7	flourishing
0.6	0.9	about

0.8	0.7

0	0.8	of

0.6	0.3	the

0.4	0.2	I

0.8	0.4	
0.7	0.1	"Don't

0.5	0.2	
0.6	0.7	The

0.2	0.4	of

0.1	0.9	I

0.7	0.7	from
0.3	1	the
0.6	0.7	quilt,

1	0.4	My

0.6	0	
1	0.3	When
0.4	0.7	I

0.1	0.4	a

1	0.8	I
0.5	0.1	well

0.9	0.9	similar
0.5	0	circumstance
0.4	0.4	that

0.6	0.3	was
0.9	0.1	a
0.6	0.7	reality
0.8	0.4	or
0.6	0.3	a
0.7	0.5	dream,
0.4	0.8	I
0.5	0.9	never

0.5	0.5	
0.5	0.6	The
0.4	1	circumstance
0.6	0.9	was
0.4	1	this.
0.8	0.2	
0.7	0.2	I

0.4	0.3	some
0.6	0.9	caper
0.3	0.4	or
0.9	0.5	other--I
0.3	0.8	think
0.2	0.6	it
0.2	0.3	was
0.9	0.3	trying

0.3	0.6	crawl
0.3	0.1	up
0.7	0.9	the
0.2	0.1	chimney,
0.5	0.7	as
0	0.4	I
0.4	0.2	had
0.3	0.4	seen
0.3	0.1	a
0.1	0	little
0.6	0.6	sweep
0.8	0.8	do
0.4	0.3	a
0.6	0.9	few
1	0.8	days
0.4	0.3	previous;
0.4	0.6	and
0	0.3	my
0.5	0.2	stepmother
0.1	0.1	who,
0.7	0.7	somehow
1	0.1	or
0.5	0.3	other,
0.7	0.7	was
0.7	0.6	all
0.6	0.5	the
0.9	0.5	time
0.9	0.7	whipping
1	0.5	me,
0.2	0.8	or
0.9	0.3	sending
0.1	0.3	me
0.4	0.1	to
0.7	0.3	bed
0.3	0.1	supperless,--my
0.5	0.2	mother
0.4	0.7	dragged
0.3	0.3	me
0.9	0.9	by
0.8	0.8	the
0.3	0.6	legs
0.8	0.3	out
0.4	0.1	of
0.3	0.4	the
0.8	0.7	chimney
0.4	0.3	and
0.6	0.6	packed
0.1	0.2	me
0.8	0.5	off
0.7	0.8	to
0	0.2	bed,
0.8	0.7	though
0.1	0.3	it
0.9	0	was
0.1	0.5	only
0.3	0.3	two
0.3	0.1	o'clock
0.7	0.5	in
0.5	0.5	the
0.6	0.8	afternoon
0.1	0.1	of
0.1	0.5	the
0	0.5	21st
0.1	0.4	June,
0.6	0.7	the
0.2	0.1	longest
0.8	0.1	day
0.9	0.8	in
0.7	0.6	the
0.4	0.6	year
1	0.3	in
0.7	0.6	our
0.7	0.9	hemisphere.
0.9	1	
0.2	0.6	I
0.8	0.9	felt
0.5	0.4	dreadfully.
0.4	0.5	
0.4	0.3	But
0.7	0.8	there
0.6	0.6	was
0.8	0.6	no
0.5	0.2	help
0.6	0.4	for
0.5	0.1	it,
0.4	0.1	so
0.6	0	up
0.6	0.2	stairs
0.2	0.5	I
0.9	0.6	went
0.7	0.7	to
0	0.4	my
0.6	0.3	little
0.8	0.7	room
0	0.7	in
0.5	0.8	the
0.1	0.1	third
0.6	0	floor,
0.9	1	undressed
1	0.3	myself
0.6	0.9	as
0.1	1	slowly
0.2	0.1	as
0.4	0.4	possible
0.3	0.3	so
0.1	0.2	as
0.7	0.6	to
0.9	0.2	kill
0.4	0.9	time,
0.7	0.8	and
0.7	0.1	with
0.4	0.9	a
0.7	0.3	bitter
0	0.8	sigh
0.2	0.2	got
0.7	1	between
0.3	0.5	the
0.7	0.2	sheets.
0.4	0.9	
1	0.6	I
0.9	0.2	lay
0.6	0.7	there
0.2	0.7	dismally
0.3	0.2	calculating
1	0.9	that
0.7	0.2	sixteen
0.5	0.5	entire
0.5	0.5	hours
0.8	0.3	must
0.3	0.9	elapse
0.3	0.3	before
0.6	0.3	I
0.4	0.6	could
0.3	0.8	hope
0.9	0.2	for
0.4	0.6	a
0.7	0.7	resurrection.
0.3	0.7	
0.6	0.5	Sixteen
0.2	0.8	hours
0.1	0.2	in
0.4	0.5	bed!
1	0.3	the
0.7	0.9	small
0	0.9	of
0.4	0.8	my
0.6	0.9	back
0.6	0.5	ached
0.2	0.5	to
0.8	0.5	think
0.6	0.3	of
0.8	0.9	it.
0.7	0.3	
0.2	0.3	And
0.5	0.4	it
0.5	0.5	was
0.3	0.8	so
0.4	0.4	light
0.5	1	too;
0.8	0.8	the
0.2	0.8	sun
0.9	0.4	shining
0.7	0.3	in
1	0.5	at
0.5	0.3	the
0.7	0.7	window,
0.3	0.2	and
0.9	0.7	a
0.9	0.1	great
0.5	0.3	rattling
0.3	0.7	of
0.2	0.1	coaches
0.6	0.4	in
0.4	0.1	the
0.8	0.3	streets,
0.3	0.5	and
0.1	0.5	the
0.2	0.5	sound
0.7	0.3	of
0.3	0.7	gay
0.3	0.3	voices
0	1	all
0.2	0.6	over
0.8	0.4	the
0.1	0.1	house.
0.4	1	
0.6	0.7	I
0.3	0.9	felt
0.8	0.4	worse
0	0.5	and
0.5	1	worse--at
0.6	0.3	last
0.5	0.4	I
0.7	0.1	got
1	0.6	up,
0.2	0.9	dressed,
1	0.1	and
1	0.6	softly
0.8	0.4	going
0.3	0.8	down
0.4	0.1	in
0.8	0.4	my
0.5	0.8	stockinged
0.6	0.4	feet,
1	0.3	sought
0.7	0.6	out
0.3	0.7	my
0.2	0.6	stepmother,
0.7	0.8	and
0.1	0.5	suddenly
0.7	0.9	threw
0.1	0	myself
0.2	0.7	at
0.1	0.2	her
0.6	0.6	feet,
0.9	0.6	beseeching
0.7	0.4	her
0	0.9	as
0.1	0.2	a
0	0.3	particular
0.5	0.7	favour
0.4	0.1	to
0.8	0.1	give
0.6	0.3	me
0.8	0.4	a
0.2	0.1	good
0.7	0.8	slippering
0.8	0.8	for
0.8	0.3	my
0.1	0.2	misbehaviour;
0.6	0.4	anything
0.6	0.7	indeed
0.4	0.8	but
0.7	0.9	condemning
0.1	0.7	me
0.6	0.9	to
0.6	0.6	lie
0.5	0.3	abed
0	0.7	such
0.5	0.9	an
0.9	0.9	unendurable
0.1	1	length
0.7	0.1	of
0.6	0.1	time.
0.8	0.6	
0.8	0.9	But
0.4	0.1	she
0.2	0.9	was
0.7	0.1	the
0.7	0.4	best
0.9	0.4	and
0.6	0.4	most
0.4	0.5	conscientious
0.8	0	of
0.8	0.6	stepmothers,
0.1	0	and
0.3	0.4	back
0.9	0.6	I
0.3	0.7	had
0.6	0.9	to
0.6	0.5	go
0.9	0.5	to
0.9	0.1	my
0.6	0.5	room.
0.2	0.2	
0.8	0.9	For
0.2	1	several
0.1	0.1	hours
0.1	0.4	I
0.8	0.1	lay
0.8	0.3	there
0.1	0.6	broad
0.1	0.9	awake,
0.4	0.8	feeling
0.4	0.5	a
0.3	0.4	great
0.5	0.3	deal
0.3	0.9	worse
0.1	1	than
0.9	0.5	I
0.8	1	have
0.6	0.6	ever
0.8	0.8	done
0.5	0.5	since,
0.5	0.5	even
0.9	0.9	from
0.9	0	the
0.1	0.6	greatest
0.8	0.1	subsequent
0.6	1	misfortunes.
0.9	0.9	
0.1	0.1	At
0.8	0.9	last
0.3	0.9	I
0.9	0.3	must
0.6	0.5	have
0.5	1	fallen
0.8	0.1	into
0.1	0.7	a
0	0.4	troubled
0	0.3	nightmare
0.7	0.8	of
0.4	1	a
0.2	0.1	doze;
0.2	0.7	and
0.9	0.2	slowly
0.8	0.2	waking
0.6	0.4	from
0.8	0.5	it--half
0.1	0.8	steeped
0.5	0.9	in
0.2	0.1	dreams--I
0.1	0.9	opened
0.4	0.4	my
0.5	1	eyes,
0.3	0.8	and
0.1	0.5	the
0.4	0.4	before
0.8	0.4	sun-lit
0.5	0.4	room
0.4	0.7	was
0.5	0.4	now
0.2	0.3	wrapped
0.3	0.5	in
0.6	0.5	outer
0.8	0.2	darkness.
0.4	0.8	
0.8	0.8	Instantly
0.4	0.8	I
0.5	0.8	felt
0.6	0.1	a
0.9	0.3	shock
0.4	0.6	running
0.7	0.6	through
0.1	0.3	all
0.7	0.9	my
0.4	0.6	frame;
1	0.9	nothing
0	0	was
0.7	0.5	to
0.1	0.2	be
0.5	1	seen,
0.5	0.8	and
0.9	0.4	nothing
0.5	0.7	was
0.5	0.3	to
0.8	0.1	be
1	0.1	heard;
0.2	0.6	but
0.1	0.8	a
0.5	0.8	supernatural
0.2	0.9	hand
0.7	0.5	seemed
0.1	0.8	placed
0.6	0.2	in
0.8	0.9	mine.
0.8	0.3	
0.6	0.5	My
0.3	0.9	arm
0.3	1	hung
0.1	0.2	over
0.6	0.5	the
0.4	0.2	counterpane,
0.9	0.5	and
0.8	0.3	the
0	0.1	nameless,
0.8	0.8	unimaginable,
0.3	0.1	silent
0.9	0.4	form
0.1	0.2	or
0.2	0.6	phantom,
0.2	0.1	to
0.6	0	which
0.8	0.2	the
0.2	0.5	hand
0.2	0.1	belonged,
0	0.7	seemed
0.9	0.1	closely
0.9	0.1	seated
0.6	0.3	by
0.3	0.7	my
0.2	0.4	bed-side.
0.7	0.6	For
0.7	0.1	what
0.3	0.8	seemed
0.3	0.9	ages
0.2	0.6	piled
0.6	0.7	on
0.3	0.2	ages,
0.6	0.6	I
0.8	0.9	lay
0.1	0.3	there,
0.3	0.2	frozen
0	0.9	with
0.2	0.1	the
0.9	0	most
0.3	1	awful
0.3	0.6	fears,
1	0.8	not
1	0.9	daring
0.5	0.4	to
0.1	0.9	drag
0.2	0.5	away
0.8	0.4	my
0	0.7	hand;
0.2	0.2	yet
0.4	0.9	ever
0.4	0.2	thinking
0.6	0	that
0.9	0.9	if
0.9	0.3	I
0.5	0.9	could
0.7	0.9	but
0.7	0.9	stir
0.7	0.2	it
0.7	0.8	one
0.1	0.9	single
0.7	0.3	inch,
0.7	0.4	the
0.1	0.5	horrid
0.1	0.3	spell
0.8	0.3	would
0.2	0.6	be
0.1	0.4	broken.
0.7	0.6	
0.6	0.8	I
0.7	0	knew
0.9	0.6	not
0.1	0.1	how
0.5	0.6	this
0.8	0.7	consciousness
0.6	1	at
0.7	0.1	last
0.4	0.6	glided
1	0.5	away
0.6	0.2	from
0.5	0.2	me;
0.8	0.4	but
0.9	1	waking
0.1	0.6	in
0.6	0.6	the
0	0.3	morning,
0.8	0.6	I
0.6	0.8	shudderingly
0.5	0.3	remembered
0.7	0.7	it
0.5	0.4	all,
0.8	0.6	and
0.6	0	for
0.4	0.6	days
0.1	0.3	and
0.7	0.3	weeks
0.9	0.4	and
0.2	0.4	months
0	0.4	afterwards
0.3	0.6	I
0.4	0.9	lost
0.2	0.8	myself
0.9	0.7	in
0.3	0.5	confounding
0.4	0.8	attempts
0.3	0.6	to
0.7	0.7	explain
0.1	0.9	the
0.1	0.8	mystery.
0.5	0.3	
0.6	0.4	Nay,
0.3	0.3	to
0.8	0.5	this
0.9	0.6	very
0	0.1	hour,
0.6	0.9	I
0.6	0.7	often
0.1	0.2	puzzle
0.8	1	myself
0.5	0.3	with
0.5	0.9	it.
0.8	0.3	
0.5	0.9	Now,
0.7	0.5	take
0.2	0.2	away
0.4	0.4	the
0.7	0.3	awful
0.4	0.1	fear,
0.1	1	and
0.6	0.7	my
0.9	0.8	sensations
0	0.3	at
0.1	1	feeling
0.3	0.4	the
0.2	0.4	supernatural
1	0.2	hand
0.1	0.8	in
0.8	0.1	mine
0.3	0.1	were
0.2	0.6	very
0.6	0.8	similar,
0.4	0.9	in
0.7	0.9	their
0.9	0.1	strangeness,
0.2	0.9	to
0.2	0	those
0.5	0.8	which
0.1	0.7	I
1	0.5	experienced
0.9	0.5	on
0.7	0.8	waking
0.3	0.8	up
0	0.7	and
1	0.4	seeing
0.3	0.4	Queequeg's
0.8	0.4	pagan
0	0.4	arm
1	0.5	thrown
0.6	0.7	round
0.8	0.1	me.
0	0.3	
0.2	0.6	But
0.6	0.6	at
0.1	0.5	length
0.3	0.5	all
0.2	0.6	the
0.9	0.1	past
0.5	0.3	night's
0.8	0.2	events
0.1	0.4	soberly
0.9	0.5	recurred,
0.8	0.8	one
0.7	0.7	by
0.5	0.8	one,
0.5	0.4	in
0.3	0.6	fixed
0.1	0.6	reality,
0	0.6	and
0.9	0.6	then
0.9	0.8	I
0.3	0.2	lay
0.8	1	only
0.5	0.2	alive
0.8	0.1	to
0.8	0.6	the
0.2	0.5	comical
0.4	0.8	predicament.
0.4	0.9	
0.8	0.9	For
0.8	0.6	though
0.7	0.2	I
0.7	0.2	tried
0.4	0.3	to
0.3	0.9	move
0.5	0.6	his
0.5	0.6	arm--unlock
0.5	0.1	his
0	0.5	bridegroom
0.3	0.8	clasp--yet,
0.2	0.9	sleeping
0.5	0.1	as
0.7	0.7	he
0.6	0.9	was,
0.5	0.9	he
0.6	0.9	still
0.3	0.8	hugged
0.4	0	me
0.9	0.6	tightly,
0.8	0.8	as
0.3	0.5	though
0	0.8	naught
0	0.7	but
1	0.5	death
0.4	0.1	should
0.9	0.9	part
0.4	0.9	us
0.7	0.9	twain.
0.3	0.5	I
0.7	0.5	now
0.7	0.8	strove
0.8	0.7	to
0.6	0.8	rouse
0.4	0.8	him--"Queequeg!"--but
0.4	0.7	his
0.3	0.7	only
0.4	0.4	answer
0.1	1	was
0.3	0.8	a
0.1	0.4	snore.
0.7	0.7	
0.5	0.3	I
0.9	0.2	then
0.9	0.3	rolled
0.5	0.2	over,
0.6	0.4	my
0.4	0.2	neck
0.1	0.7	feeling
0.6	0.4	as
0	0.2	if
0.2	0.2	it
0.7	0.6	were
0.5	0.8	in
0.8	0.4	a
0.2	0.3	horse-collar;
0.7	0.8	and
0.3	0.4	suddenly
0.7	0.4	felt
0.5	0.9	a
0.1	0.2	slight
0.3	0.6	scratch.
0.6	0.6	
0.8	0.9	Throwing
0.8	0.1	aside
0.3	0.1	the
0.9	0.3	counterpane,
0.8	0	there
0.3	0	lay
0.5	0.9	the
0.3	0.9	tomahawk
0.8	0.7	sleeping
0.9	0.9	by
0.8	0.6	the
0.7	1	savage's
0.6	0.5	side,
0.4	0.7	as
0.4	0.3	if
1	1	it
0.3	0.5	were
0.5	0.7	a
0.1	0.4	hatchet-faced
0.6	0.7	baby.
0.6	0.6	
0.3	1	A
0.3	0.6	pretty
0.4	0.5	pickle,
0.4	0	truly,
0.7	0.7	thought
0.2	0.3	I;
0.6	0.5	abed
0.6	0.3	here
0.3	0.6	in
0.2	0.8	a
0.2	0.2	strange
0.8	0.5	house
0.2	0	in
0.8	0.6	the
0.3	0	broad
0.3	0.1	day,
0.4	0.1	with
0.1	0.4	a
0.3	0.6	cannibal
0.2	0.3	and
0.1	0	a
0.8	0.5	tomahawk!
0.3	0.6	
0.7	0.9	"Queequeg!--in
0.3	0.3	the
0.5	0.8	name
0.9	0.3	of

0.3	0.7	wake!"
0.1	1	
0.4	0.4	At
0.9	0.5	length,
0.8	0.2	by
0	0.8	dint
0.8	1	of

0.3	0.3	wriggling,
0.3	0.9	and
0.8	0.2	loud
0.1	0.5	and
0.5	0.1	incessant
0.9	0.2	expostulations
0.1	0.7	upon
0.1	0.2	the

0.3	0.3	matrimonial
0.8	0	sort
0.3	0.2	of
0.3	0.8	style,
0.5	0.7	I
0.6	0	succeeded
0.4	0.5	in
0.6	0.2	extracting
1	0.2	a
0.9	1	grunt;
0.7	0.5	and
0.3	0.1	presently,
0.9	0.7	he
0.1	0.9	drew
0.1	0.2	back
0.4	0.8	his
0.6	0.7	arm,
0.4	0.2	shook
0.4	0.5	himself
0.6	0.6	all
0.5	0.6	over
0.5	0.8	like
0.8	0.7	a
0.8	0.4	Newfoundland
0.4	0.9	dog
0.4	0.1	just
0	0.3	from
0.8	0.6	the
0	0.8	water,
0.2	0.2	and
0.8	0.6	sat
0.3	0.7	up
0.2	0.7	in
0.7	0.4	bed,
0.1	0.5	stiff
0.6	0.5	as
0.8	0.2	a
0.5	0.7	pike-staff,
0.6	0.9	looking
0.3	0.9	at
1	0.1	me,
0.2	0.1	and
0.6	0.1	rubbing
0.8	0.4	his
0.9	1	eyes
0.9	0.3	as
0.3	0.6	if
0.4	0.5	he
0.8	0	did
0.5	0.7	not
1	0.2	altogether
0.7	0	remember
0.3	0.1	how
0.9	0.8	I
0.7	0.6	came
0.3	0.6	to
0.4	0.8	be
0.3	0.7	there,
1	0.1	though
0.4	0.8	a
0.3	0.3	dim
0.8	0.6	consciousness
0.7	0.6	of
0.7	0.8	knowing
0.8	0.1	something
0.1	0.7	about
0.1	0.8	me
0.4	0.2	seemed
0.2	0.9	slowly
0.9	0.5	dawning
0.8	0.9	over
0.7	0.4	him.
0.3	0.1	
0.5	0.8	Meanwhile,
0.8	0.3	I
0.8	1	lay
0.5	0.5	quietly
0.7	0.5	eyeing
0.4	0.7	him,
0.6	0.8	having
0.4	0.6	no
0.8	0.9	serious
0.9	0.9	misgivings
0.5	0.5	now,
0.5	0.3	and
0.2	0.6	bent
0.8	0.7	upon
0.6	0.7	narrowly
0.3	0.8	observing
0.1	0.2	so
0.7	0.3	curious
0.8	0.2	a
0	0.5	creature.
0.6	0.8	
0.4	0.1	When,
0.6	0.9	at
0.4	0.8	last,
0.2	0.1	his
0.8	0.6	mind
0.8	0.5	seemed
0.2	0.4	made
0.9	0.4	up
0.7	0.3	touching
0.9	0	the
0.9	0.1	character
0.6	0.3	of
0.2	0	his
0.3	1	bedfellow,
0.5	0.8	and
0.2	0.1	he
0.5	0.8	became,
0.5	0.4	as
0.9	0.3	it
0.9	0.9	were,
0.6	0.1	reconciled
0.6	0.6	to
0.7	0.3	the
0.8	0.6	fact;
0.8	0.4	he
1	0.1	jumped
0.1	0.2	out
0.3	0.7	upon
0.7	0.2	the
0.9	0.1	floor,
0.5	1	and
0.2	0.5	by
0.5	0.2	certain
0.3	0.4	signs
0.2	0.2	and
0.2	0.4	sounds
0.7	0.2	gave
0.3	0.2	me
0.7	0.3	to
0.7	0.8	understand
0.4	0.5	that,
1	1	if
0.1	0.1	it
0.3	0.3	pleased
0.4	0.4	me,
0.7	0.8	he
0.6	0.1	would
0.5	0.7	dress
0.2	0.2	first
0.7	0.1	and
0	0.2	then
0.6	0.7	leave
1	0.1	me
0.5	0.8	to
0.6	1	dress
0.3	0.1	afterwards,
1	0.7	leaving
0.3	0.1	the
0.3	0.7	whole
0.5	0.8	apartment
1	0.3	to
0.6	0.6	myself.
0.4	0.1	
0.8	0.9	Thinks
0.7	0.1	I,
0.7	0.3	Queequeg,
0.5	0	under
0	0.5	the
0.7	0.4	circumstances,
0.8	0.2	this
0.3	0	is
0.9	0.2	a
0.8	1	very
0.7	0.1	civilized
0.1	0.3	overture;
0.4	0.2	but,
0.3	0.2	the
0.8	0.5	truth
0.9	0	is,
0.7	0.5	these
0.1	0.9	savages
0.6	0.7	have
0.6	0.2	an
0.6	0.7	innate
0.4	0.5	sense
1	0.4	of
0.8	0	delicacy,
0.8	0.3	say
0.1	0.4	what
0.7	0.9	you
0.2	0.4	will;
0.5	0.1	it
0.1	0.3	is
0.7	0.7	marvellous
0	0.9	how
1	0.9	essentially
0.3	0.9	polite
0.7	0.9	they
0.5	0.7	are.
0.1	0.1	
0.4	0.1	I
0.1	0.4	pay
0.3	0.3	this
0.8	0.3	particular
0.6	1	compliment
1	0.1	to
0.9	0.2	Queequeg,
0.5	1	because
0.6	0.7	he
0.8	0.3	treated
0.1	0.7	me
0.3	0.5	with
0.7	0.3	so
0.7	0.1	much
0.8	0.4	civility
0.9	0.4	and
0.1	1	consideration,
0.7	0.6	while
0.1	0.3	I
0.6	0.5	was
0.3	0.7	guilty
0.2	0.2	of
0.1	0.6	great
0.2	0.6	rudeness;
0.6	0.5	staring
0.6	0.3	at
0.9	0.4	him
0.2	0.6	from
0.3	0.3	the
0.4	0.2	bed,
0.5	0.9	and
0.8	0.3	watching
0	0.1	all
0	0.1	his
0.1	0.4	toilette
0.4	0.2	motions;
0.5	0.5	for
0.4	0.9	the
0.4	0.3	time
0.4	0.6	my
0.4	0.2	curiosity
0.5	0.4	getting
0.2	0.7	the
0.8	0.8	better
0.1	0.7	of
0.3	0.3	my
0.3	0.5	breeding.
1	0.2	
0.9	0.7	Nevertheless,
0	0.1	a
0.8	0.5	man
0.1	0.3	like
0.5	0.8	Queequeg
0.9	0.5	you
0.3	0.1	don't
0.1	0.5	see
0.2	0.1	every
0.3	0.5	day,
1	0.4	he
0.8	0.5	and
0.4	0.1	his
0.7	0.9	ways
0.1	0.3	were
0.5	0.4	well
1	0.7	worth
0.3	0.1	unusual
0	0.9	regarding.
0.1	0.5	
0.3	0.7	He
0.2	0.3	commenced
0.1	0.1	dressing
0.9	0.7	at
0.5	0.9	top
0.5	0.7	by
0.8	1	donning
0.4	0.3	his
0.3	0.1	beaver
0.8	0	hat,
0.7	0.2	a
1	0.6	very
0.9	0.7	tall
0.8	0.5	one,
0	0.5	by
0.5	0.3	the
0.7	0.6	by,
0.8	0.2	and
0.2	0.4	then--still
0.7	0.5	minus
0.4	0.2	his
0.2	0.1	trowsers--he
0.1	0.1	hunted
0.8	0.7	up
0.9	0.8	his
0.3	0.4	boots.
0.3	0.7	
0.7	0.1	What
0.6	0.1	under
0.9	0.5	the
0.3	0.4	heavens
0.7	0.6	he
0.1	1	did
0.3	0.7	it
0.5	0.5	for,
0.3	0.6	I
0.3	0.1	cannot
0.9	0.9	tell,
0.5	0.4	but
0.5	0.8	his
0.5	0.1	next
0.3	0.4	movement
0.6	0.3	was
0.3	0	to
0.9	0.3	crush
0.5	0	himself--boots
0.2	0.1	in
0.3	0.5	hand,
0.1	0.3	and
0.4	0.4	hat
0.8	0.7	on--under
0.3	0.7	the
0.3	0.3	bed;
0.5	0.1	when,
0.3	0.3	from
0.1	0.6	sundry
0.5	0.9	violent
0.8	0.8	gaspings
1	0.3	and
0.3	0.3	strainings,
0.6	0.4	I
0.5	0.3	inferred
0.2	0.8	he
0.5	0.1	was
0.8	0.3	hard
0.3	0.3	at
0.2	0.6	work
0.6	0.9	booting
0.8	0.7	himself;
0.1	0.3	though
0.1	0.1	by
0.8	0.7	no
0.4	0.3	law
0.5	0.4	of
0.2	0.5	propriety
0.3	0.5	that
0.2	0.7	I
0.9	0.9	ever
0.1	0.1	heard
0.9	0.5	of,
0.5	0.3	is
0	0	any
0	0.8	man
0.1	0.5	required
0.4	0.2	to
0.6	0.7	be
0.2	0.6	private
0.5	0.5	when
0.2	0.9	putting
0.1	0.3	on
0.2	0	his
0.1	0.1	boots.
0.1	0.7	
0.5	0.8	But
0.6	0.2	Queequeg,
0.5	0.5	do
0.5	0.9	you
0.8	0.1	see,
0.1	0.5	was
0.3	0.1	a
0.8	0.2	creature
0.7	0.5	in
0.2	0.3	the
0.7	0.2	transition
0.5	0.8	stage--neither
0.4	0.8	caterpillar
0.2	0.8	nor
0.5	0.2	butterfly.
0.2	1	
0.4	0.1	He
0.9	0.1	was
0.5	0.2	just
0.1	0.9	enough
0.5	0.9	civilized
0.9	0.3	to
0.9	0.5	show
0.9	0.3	off
0.3	0.2	his
1	1	outlandishness
0.3	0	in
0	0.9	the
0.1	0.7	strangest
0.7	1	possible
0.9	0.7	manners.
0.1	1	
0.2	0.4	His
0.1	0.5	education
0.5	0.3	was
0.1	0.6	not
0.7	0.6	yet
0.6	0.3	completed.
0.8	0.2	
0.5	0.7	He
0.7	0.8	was
0.1	0.5	an
0.7	0.6	undergraduate.
0.9	0.6	
0.3	0.8	If
0.3	0.3	he
0.8	0.7	had
0.4	0.1	not
0.4	1	been
0.3	0.6	a
0.4	0.9	small
0.4	0.8	degree
0.7	0.5	civilized,
0.6	0.7	he
0.4	0.4	very
0.3	0.6	probably
0.7	0.6	would
0.6	0.9	not
0.3	0.9	have
0.5	0.7	troubled
0.5	0.5	himself
0.7	0.1	with
0.9	0.2	boots
0.7	0.1	at
0.2	0.8	all;
0.9	0.6	but
0.4	0.6	then,
1	0.2	if
0.6	0.7	he
0.7	0.1	had
0.9	0.3	not
0.6	0.3	been
0.9	0.1	still
0.2	0	a
0.6	0.9	savage,
0.7	0.9	he
0.1	0.7	never
0.8	0.1	would
0.6	0.1	have
0.9	0.1	dreamt
1	0.7	of
0.7	0.3	getting
0.1	0.7	under
0	0.2	the
0.9	0	bed
0.4	0.1	to
0.9	0	put
0.2	0.7	them
0.6	0.4	on.
0.6	0.1	
0.2	0.2	At
0.6	0.1	last,
0.9	0.7	he
0.6	0.1	emerged
0.4	0.3	with
0.7	0.7	his
0.7	0.8	hat
0.5	0.5	very
0.4	0.1	much
0.1	0.9	dented
0.8	0.3	and
0.3	0.4	crushed
0.1	0.7	down
0.4	0.6	over
0.7	0.9	his
0.4	0.1	eyes,
0.7	0.1	and
0.9	0.1	began
0.8	0.2	creaking
0.5	0.7	and
0.7	0.7	limping
0.4	0.8	about
0.6	0.9	the
0.9	0.5	room,
1	0.4	as
0.1	0.2	if,
0.9	0.1	not
0	0.7	being
0.6	0.4	much
0.4	0.3	accustomed
0.4	0.6	to
0.6	0.4	boots,
0.3	0.1	his
0.5	0.1	pair
0.1	0.5	of
0.5	0.5	damp,
0.8	0.4	wrinkled
0.9	0.1	cowhide
0.9	0.9	ones--probably
0.8	0.9	not
0.5	0.7	made
0.1	0.5	to
0.3	0.2	order
0.5	0.3	either--rather
0.7	0.7	pinched
0.1	0.9	and
0.5	0.7	tormented
0.9	0.5	him
0.7	0.1	at
0.9	0.3	the
0.8	0.3	first
0.1	0.9	go
0.4	0.1	off
0.4	0.2	of
0.2	0.4	a
0.9	0.1	bitter
0.9	0.3	cold
0.1	0.7	morning.
0.7	0.1	
0.8	0.4	Seeing,
0.3	0.7	now,
0.1	0.7	that
0.7	0	there
0.5	0.7	were
0.9	0.2	no
0	0.3	curtains
0.5	0.2	to
0.3	0.4	the

0.9	0.1	and
0.7	0.1	that
0.5	0.8	the
0.8	0.7	street
0.5	0.1	being
0.2	0.4	very
0.3	0.2	narrow,
0.9	0.8	the
0.8	0.7	house
0.1	0.6	opposite
0.5	0.8	commanded
0.7	1	a
0.3	0.3	plain
0.6	0.4	view
1	0.1	into
0.4	0.3	the
0.6	0.1	room,
0	0.3	and
0.7	0.3	observing
0.5	0.8	more
0.6	0.8	and
0.5	0.7	more
0.9	0.9	the
0.3	0.4	indecorous
1	0.3	figure
0.5	0.8	that
0.3	0	Queequeg
0	0.1	made,
0.1	0.9	staving
0.9	0.1	about
0.6	0.1	with
0.3	0.5	little
0.9	0.3	else
0.2	0.2	but
0.6	0.3	his
0.8	0.7	hat
0.6	0.7	and
0.7	0.4	boots
0.4	0.6	on;
0.3	0.3	I
0	0.2	begged
0.4	0.1	him
0.5	0.3	as
0.8	0.3	well
0.8	0.4	as
0.2	0.3	I
0.1	1	could,
0.1	0.8	to
0	0.8	accelerate
0.7	0.7	his
0.9	0.4	toilet
0.6	0.6	somewhat,
0.2	1	and
0.8	0.7	particularly
0.7	0.5	to
1	0.9	get

0.6	0.3	as
0.9	0.4	soon
0.7	1	as
0.6	0	possible.
0.8	0.8	
0.8	0.7	He
0.1	0.3	complied,
0.8	0	and
0.5	0.6	then
0.7	0.5	proceeded
0.8	0.5	to
0.6	0.8	wash
0.8	0.6	himself.
0	0	
0.9	0.6	At
0.3	0.5	that
0.2	0	time
0.9	0.2	in
0.4	0.4	the
0	0.1	morning
0.5	0.9	any
0.1	0.3	Christian
0.8	0.1	would
1	0.7	have
0.3	0.9	washed
1	1	his
0.1	0.4	face;
0.8	0.8	but
0.6	0.5	Queequeg,
0.6	0	to
0.2	0.1	my
0.6	0.7	amazement,
0.8	0	contented
0.9	0.8	himself
0.2	0.6	with
0.8	0.3	restricting
0.6	0.4	his
0.3	0.6	ablutions
0.1	0.8	to

0	0.5	and
0.4	0.4	hands.
0.7	0.3	
0.3	0.2	He
0.1	0.9	then
0.9	0.4	donned
0.3	0.9	his
0.4	0.9	waistcoat,
0.7	0.5	and
0.3	0.2	taking

0.1	0.8	and
0.8	0.5	commenced
0.2	0.1	lathering
0.1	0.5	his

0.3	0.1	I
0.5	0.4	was
0.6	0.5	watching

0.7	0.3	his

0.6	0.8	and
0.3	0.5	striding
0.1	1	up
0.1	0.4	to
0.1	0.1	the
0	0.5	bit
0.2	0.6	of

0.9	0	the

0.1	0.6	begins
0.4	0.1	a
0.2	0.4	vigorous
0.6	0.2	scraping,
0.8	0.7	or
0.2	0.1	rather
0.7	0.2	harpooning
0.3	0.7	of
0.6	0.4	his
0.5	0	cheeks.
0.9	0.7	
0.7	0.9	Thinks
0.3	0.5	I,
0.7	0.3	Queequeg,
0.7	0.2	this
0.7	0.7	is
0.8	0.3	using
0.6	0.4	Rogers's
0.6	0.8	best
0.9	1	cutlery
0.1	0.5	with
0.8	0.4	a
0.6	0.8	vengeance.
0.6	0.8	
0.3	0.8	Afterwards
0.3	0.3	I
0.4	1	wondered
0.8	0.4	the
0.2	0.6	less
0.1	0.4	at
0.1	0.9	this
0.1	0.2	operation
0.9	0.6	when
0.4	0.8	I
0.1	0.5	came
0.6	0.6	to
0.7	0.2	know
0	0.9	of
0.4	0.2	what
1	0.3	fine
0.2	0.6	steel
0.6	0.4	the
0.5	0.6	head
0.8	0.3	of
0.3	0.6	a
0.7	0.7	harpoon
0.5	0.1	is
0.6	0.9	made,
0.6	0.5	and
0.3	0.3	how
0.4	0.3	exceedingly
0.1	0.1	sharp
0.5	0	the
0.4	0.7	long
0.5	0.8	straight
0	0.2	edges
0.2	0.2	are
0.9	0.7	always
0.6	0.2	kept.
0.1	0.2	
0.2	0.8	The
0.2	0.2	rest
0.1	0.4	of
0.3	0.8	his
0.8	0.1	toilet
0.8	0	was
0.4	0.7	soon
0.8	0.5	achieved,
0.2	0.8	and
0.5	1	he
0.8	0.1	proudly
0.6	0.3	marched
0.2	0.6	out
0.4	0.2	of
0.8	0.7	the
0.1	0.1	room,
0.3	0.4	wrapped
0.3	0.8	up
0.9	0.1	in
0.1	0.3	his
0.1	0.1	great
0.6	1	pilot
0.1	0.2	monkey
0.6	0.3	jacket,
0.5	0.1	and
0.7	0.7	sporting
0.3	0.3	his
0.3	0.7	harpoon
0.2	0.5	like
0.2	0.5	a

0.5	0.5	
0.8	0.3	Breakfast.
0.9	0.9	
1	0.7	
0	0.6	I
0.7	0.5	quickly
0.5	0.6	followed
0.9	0.3	suit,
0.8	0.8	and
0.7	0.6	descending
0.3	0.5	into
1	0.3	the
0	0.8	bar-room
0.9	0.4	accosted
1	0.5	the
0.8	0.4	grinning
0.9	0.1	landlord
0.8	0.9	very
0.4	0.7	pleasantly.
0	0.3	
0.7	0.6	I
0.5	0.9	cherished
0.5	0.1	no
0.4	0.4	malice
0.5	0.1	towards
0.8	0.3	him,
0.4	0.2	though
0.2	0.1	he
0.1	0	had
0	0.1	been
0.4	0.8	skylarking
0.2	0.6	with
0.9	0.1	me
0.4	0.3	not
0.3	0.8	a
0.4	0.2	little
0.6	0	in
0.7	0.2	the
0.7	0.6	matter
0.6	0.8	of
0.4	0.9	my
0.6	0.9	bedfellow.
0.4	0.3	
0.3	0.6	However,
0.8	0.3	a
0.1	1	good
1	0.7	laugh
0.2	0.3	is
0	0.4	a
0.5	0.7	mighty
0.9	0.4	good
0.8	0.1	thing,
0.2	0.8	and
0.8	0.6	rather
0.6	0.4	too
0	0.4	scarce
0.5	0.5	a
0.1	0.7	good
0.9	0.5	thing;
0.5	0	the
0.6	0.7	more's
0	0.2	the
0.2	0.8	pity.
0.8	0.9	
0.7	0.3	So,
0.9	0.5	if
0.7	0.3	any
0.3	0.8	one
0.9	0.3	man,
0.3	0.1	in
0.3	0.9	his

0.6	0.1	afford
0.1	0.3	stuff
0.1	0.7	for
0.3	0.2	a
0.2	0.7	good
0.8	0.2	joke
0.9	0.8	to
0.1	0.6	anybody,
0.6	0.7	let
0.4	0.7	him
0.5	0.3	not
0.4	0.8	be
0.1	0.3	backward,
0.9	0	but
0.8	0.9	let
0.6	0.4	him
0.8	0.1	cheerfully
0.6	0.9	allow
0.6	0.3	himself
1	0.2	to
0.3	0.3	spend
0.6	1	and
0.6	0.8	be
0.2	0.2	spent
0.9	0.6	in
0.4	0.4	that
0.1	0	way.
0.4	0.5	
0.7	0.5	And
0.1	0.6	the
0.1	0.9	man
0.2	0.6	that
0.7	0.7	has
0.8	0.4	anything
0.3	0.8	bountifully
0.9	0.6	laughable
1	0.1	about
0.4	0.4	him,
0.6	0.6	be
0.9	0	sure
0.4	0.9	there
0.3	0.2	is
0.1	0.3	more
0.1	0.9	in
0.8	0.1	that
0.9	0.8	man
0.3	1	than
0.7	0.9	you
0.3	0.5	perhaps
0.4	0.2	think
0.5	0.3	for.
0.5	0.1	
0.7	0.6	The
0.9	0.2	bar-room
0.2	0.3	was
0.9	1	now
0.7	0.4	full
0.3	0.4	of
0.2	0.3	the
0	0.6	boarders
0.3	0.7	who
0.1	0.5	had
0.5	0.8	been
0	0.5	dropping
0.8	0.4	in
0.9	0.9	the
0.1	0.8	night
0.7	0.1	previous,
0.9	0.5	and
0.4	0.8	whom
0.6	1	I
0.7	0.1	had
0.5	0.3	not
0.8	0.5	as
0.8	0.1	yet
0.1	0.1	had
0.4	0.2	a
0.3	0.8	good
0.8	0.3	look
0.7	0.1	at.
0.8	0	They
0.8	0.2	were
0.9	0.5	nearly
0.4	0.2	all
0.2	0.6	whalemen;
0.1	0.6	chief
0.2	0.1	mates,
0.3	1	and
0.7	0.9	second
0.6	0.7	mates,
0.8	0.8	and

0.6	0.2	and
0.3	0.8	sea
0.8	1	carpenters,
0.7	0.1	and
0.7	0.8	sea
0.5	1	coopers,
0.2	0.7	and
0.5	0.7	sea
0.9	0.8	blacksmiths,
0.4	0.7	and
0.1	0.5	harpooneers,
0.6	0.3	and
0.4	0.5	ship
0.8	0.5	keepers;
0	0.7	a
0	0.8	brown
0.8	0.5	and
0.1	0.7	brawny
0.6	0.8	company,
0.5	0.8	with
0.7	0.2	bosky
0.1	0.4	beards;
0	0.1	an
0.7	0.5	unshorn,
0.8	0.8	shaggy
0.2	0.5	set,
0.1	0.9	all
0.6	0.5	wearing
0.5	0.7	monkey
0.4	0.1	jackets
0.3	0.8	for
0.3	0.1	morning
0	1	gowns.
0.5	0.3	
0.5	1	You
0.9	0.3	could
0.1	0.1	pretty
0.7	0.5	plainly
0.9	0.1	tell
0.6	0.1	how
0.9	0.3	long
0.4	0.9	each
0.2	0.5	one
0.4	0.2	had
0.8	0.3	been
0.1	0.8	ashore.
0.6	0.7	This
0.9	0.9	young
1	0.8	fellow's
0.1	0.7	healthy
0.5	0.4	cheek
0.2	0.8	is
0.4	0.5	like
0.4	0.7	a
0.3	1	sun-toasted
0.6	0.2	pear
0.4	0.8	in
0.7	0.6	hue,
0.6	0.7	and
0.9	0.2	would
0.7	0.6	seem
0.7	0	to
0.6	0.1	smell
1	0.1	almost
0.7	0.6	as
0.7	0.4	musky;
0.2	0.8	he
0.2	0.5	cannot
0.3	0.3	have
0.8	0.7	been
0.9	0.4	three
0.5	0.1	days
0.2	0.8	landed
0.2	0.4	from
0.2	0.3	his
0.3	0.2	Indian
0	0.3	voyage.
0.1	0.8	
0.6	0.7	That
0.6	0.6	man
0.5	0.1	next
0.3	1	him
0.8	0.9	looks
0.8	1	a
0.8	0.3	few
0.1	0.4	shades
0.7	0.6	lighter;
0.4	0.4	you
1	0.8	might
0.1	0.7	say
0.2	0.6	a
0.9	0.9	touch
0.8	0	of
0.8	0	satin
0.1	0.6	wood
0.8	0.9	is
0.9	0.8	in
0.8	0.2	him.
0.2	0.6	
0.9	0.6	In
0.1	0.7	the
1	0.8	complexion
0.9	1	of
0.3	0	a
0.2	0.8	third
0.8	0.5	still
0.4	0.1	lingers
0.6	0.1	a
0.2	0.2	tropic
0.7	0	tawn,
0.3	0.1	but
0.8	0.2	slightly
0.6	0.9	bleached
0.3	0.7	withal;
0	0.1	HE
0.6	1	doubtless
0.3	0.4	has
0.5	0.4	tarried
0.3	0.3	whole
0.9	1	weeks
0.2	0.2	ashore.
0.9	0.4	
0.5	0.8	But
0.3	0	who
0.3	0.7	could
0.7	0.3	show
0.7	0.9	a
0.2	0.7	cheek
0.4	1	like
0.9	1	Queequeg?
0.4	0.3	which,
0.6	0.8	barred
0.9	0.5	with
0.7	0.3	various
0.7	0.3	tints,
0.1	0.1	seemed
0.1	1	like
0.4	0	the
0.8	0.7	Andes'
0.9	0.6	western
0.1	0.8	slope,
0.3	0.9	to
0.1	0.7	show
0.5	0.1	forth
0.6	0.3	in
0.1	0.2	one
0.7	1	array,
0.5	0.6	contrasting
0.9	0.8	climates,
0	0.9	zone
0.1	0.1	by
0.3	0.5	zone.
0.7	0.7	
0.3	0.7	"Grub,
0.5	0.3	ho!"
0	0.1	now
0.5	0.8	cried
0.9	0.9	the
0.7	0.7	landlord,
0.1	0.5	flinging
1	0.1	open
0.9	0.3	a
0.9	0.9	door,
0.5	0.8	and
0.5	0.2	in
0.4	0.8	we
0.9	0.9	went
0.7	1	to
0.9	0.6	breakfast.
0	0.8	
0.8	0.9	They
0.8	0.7	say
0.4	0.5	that
0.8	0.7	men
1	0.4	who
0.3	0.8	have
0.2	0.3	seen
0.5	0.1	the
0.1	0.5	world,
0.5	0.2	thereby
0.2	0.9	become
0.7	0.3	quite
0.2	0.9	at
0.5	0.3	ease
0.8	0.2	in
0.6	0.1	manner,
1	0.8	quite
0.3	0.9	self-possessed
0.2	1	in
0.9	0.7	company.
0.1	0.9	
0.3	0.3	Not
0.1	0.2	always,
0.4	0.8	though:
0.9	0.9	Ledyard,
0.1	0.3	the
0.6	0.4	great
0.2	0.5	New
0.1	1	England
0.4	0	traveller,
0.5	0.8	and
0.3	0	Mungo
0.1	0.3	Park,
0.2	0.6	the
0.4	0.6	Scotch
0.7	0.4	one;
0.8	0.4	of
1	1	all
0.9	0.7	men,
0.9	0.9	they
0.8	0.2	possessed
0.8	0.8	the
0.2	0.4	least
0.9	0.7	assurance
0.9	0	in
0.6	0.4	the
0.9	0	parlor.
0.2	0.5	But
0.8	0.9	perhaps
1	0.1	the

0.9	0.3	of

0.9	0.1	heart
0.8	0.7	of
0.6	0.1	Africa,
0.2	0.9	which
0.3	0.3	was
0.5	0.1	the
0.7	0.7	sum
0.2	0.4	of
0.8	0.5	poor
0.5	0.4	Mungo's
0.2	0.2	performances--this
0	0.8	kind
0.7	0.4	of
0.6	0.6	travel,
0.7	0.7	I
0.8	0.1	say,
0.8	0.5	may
0.6	0.7	not
0.6	0.9	be
0.6	0.3	the

0.6	0.7	best
0.5	0.2	mode
0.9	0.9	of
0.1	0	attaining

0.2	0.7	high
0.9	0.3	social
0.1	0.8	polish.
0.1	0.1	
0.9	0.8	Still,
0.6	0.7	for
0.4	0.7	the
0.1	0.4	most
0.2	0.2	part,
0.4	0.2	that
0.5	0.2	sort
0.8	0.3	of

0.6	0.8	is
0.9	0.1	to

0.9	0.7	
0.1	0.3	These
0.3	0	reflections
0.4	0.3	just
0.8	0	here
0.6	0.5	are
0.3	0.8	occasioned
0.8	0.9	by
0.3	0.4	the
0.9	0.8	circumstance
0.5	0.9	that
0.3	0.7	after
0.3	0.2	we
0.2	0.7	were
1	0.4	all
0.3	0.6	seated
0.8	0.8	at
0.5	0.1	the
0.8	0.3	table,
0.4	0.8	and
0.2	0.1	I
0.7	0.9	was
0.5	0.8	preparing
0.7	0.5	to
0.9	0.5	hear
0.6	0.9	some
0.8	0.4	good
0.1	0	stories
0.5	0.3	about
0.7	0.8	whaling;
0.7	0.1	to
0.8	0.7	my
0.9	0.4	no
0	0.8	small
0.8	0.8	surprise,
0.5	0.2	nearly
0.4	0.9	every
0.9	0.3	man
0.5	0.2	maintained
0.4	0.7	a
0.3	0.7	profound
0.8	0.6	silence.
0.5	0.8	
0.2	0.2	And
0.2	0.5	not
0.7	0.6	only
0	0.5	that,
0.5	0.2	but
0.6	1	they
0.3	1	looked
0.8	0.3	embarrassed.
0.3	0.1	
0.8	0.4	Yes,
0.2	0.2	here
0.8	0.2	were
0.7	0.3	a
1	0.1	set
1	1	of
0.1	0.9	sea-dogs,
0.8	0.8	many
0.9	0.4	of
0.8	0.4	whom
0.3	0.6	without
0.5	0.8	the

0.8	0.8	to
0.9	0.5	them--and
0.4	1	duelled
0.5	0.5	them
0	0.9	dead
0.8	0.3	without
0.8	0.6	winking;
0.7	1	and
0.8	0.3	yet,
1	0.9	here
0.2	0.7	they
0.8	0.4	sat
0.3	0.8	at
0.3	0.8	a

1	0.4	calling,
0.9	1	all
0.3	0.8	of

0.5	0.9	as
0.1	0.4	sheepishly
0.2	0.6	at
0.5	0.6	each
0.3	0.8	other
1	0	as
0.5	0	though
0.8	0.5	they

0.1	0.6	of
0	0.6	a

0.3	0.2	I

0.1	0.8	
0.9	0.7	Yes,

0.5	0.1	
0.8	0	But
0.8	0.6	somehow

0.7	0	
0.2	0.1	Delightful

0.7	0.1	chance
0.6	1	for

1	0.2	it
0.4	0.7	seems--aye,
0.9	0.6	a
0.2	0.1	stove
0.5	0.8	boat
0.9	0.7	will
0.6	0.9	make
0.5	0.6	me
0.4	0.1	an

0.2	0.3	by
0	0.8	brevet.
0.7	0.5	
0.5	1	Yes,
0.3	0.8	there
0.7	0.1	is
0.3	0.7	death
0.3	0.5	in
0.8	0.6	this
0.6	0.3	business
0.5	0.3	of

0.1	0.6	quick
0.4	0.9	chaotic
0.2	0.6	bundling
0.7	0.1	of

0.4	0.6	
0.7	0.3	But
0.6	0.6	what
0.7	0.9	then?
0.2	0.3	
0.9	0.8	Methinks
0.9	0.3	we
0.7	0.3	have
0.7	0.3	hugely
0.1	0.3	mistaken
0.3	0.1	this

0.4	0.2	
0.3	0.6	Methinks

0.8	0.7	my
0.3	0.4	shadow
0.6	0.8	here
0.6	0.9	on

0.4	0.3	true
0.7	0.7	substance.
0.3	0.6	
0.1	0.8	Methinks
0.7	0.9	that
0.4	0	in
0.2	0.3	looking
0.3	0.4	at
0.6	0.6	things
0.1	0.5	spiritual,
0.2	0.4	we

0.4	0.1	the

0.6	0.4	Methinks
0.7	1	my

0.9	0.9	is
0.6	0.8	but
0.1	0.5	the
0.3	0.3	lees

0.5	0.3	I

0.6	0.8	
1	0.8	No,

0.2	0.3	round
0.3	0.4	Jonah,
0.2	0.3	prepared
0.5	0.1	to
0.8	0.2	lay
0.2	0.3	their
0.5	0.2	hands
0.4	0.3	upon
0	1	him.
0.1	0.5	
0.2	0.1	Frighted
0.9	0.3	Jonah
0.1	0.1	trembles,
1	0.7	and
0.4	0	summoning
0.6	0.3	all
0.8	0.1	his
0.3	0.8	boldness
0.6	0.7	to
0.6	0.9	his
0.1	0.7	face,
0.1	0.2	only
0.2	0.7	looks
0.7	0.2	so
0.4	1	much
0.7	0.4	the
0.5	0.6	more
0.2	0.1	a
0.8	0.7	coward.
0.9	0.1	
0.5	0.9	He
0.4	0.5	will
0.3	0.8	not
0.7	0	confess
0.4	0.5	himself
0.2	0.3	suspected;
1	0	but
1	0.6	that
0.9	0	itself
0.5	0.1	is
0.8	0.7	strong
0.8	0.7	suspicion.
0.7	0.7	So
0.5	1	he
0.3	0.8	makes
0.2	1	the
0.9	0.5	best
0.3	0.7	of
0.7	0.5	it;
0.5	0.8	and
0.1	0.7	when
0.7	0.3	the

0.5	0.1	find
0	0.4	him
0.9	0.4	not
0.6	0.6	to
0.8	0.6	be
0.8	0.4	the
0.7	0.6	man
0.7	0.4	that
0.8	0.9	is

0.2	0.6	they
0.6	0.2	let

0.7	0.9	and
0.2	0.6	he
0.3	0.1	descends
0.3	0	into
0.1	0.8	the
0	0.2	cabin.
0.7	0.8	
0.8	0.8	"'Who's
0.2	0.6	there?'
0.8	0.4	cries
0.3	0.9	the
0.9	0.8	Captain
0.6	0.8	at
0.8	0.8	his
0.5	0.5	busy
0	0	desk,
1	0.4	hurriedly
0.1	0.3	making
0.2	0.4	out
0.8	0.6	his
0.5	0.6	papers
0.2	0	for
0.5	0.4	the
0.9	0.8	Customs--'Who's
0.5	0.3	there?'
0.4	0	
0.9	0.6	Oh!
0.4	0.2	how
0.6	0.6	that
0.5	0.8	harmless
0.1	0.9	question
0.3	1	mangles
0.8	1	Jonah!
0.4	0.8	
0.3	0.7	For
0.6	0.6	the
0.8	0	instant
0.1	0.1	he
0.6	0.4	almost
0.3	0.1	turns
0.8	0.5	to
1	0.5	flee
1	0.5	again.
0.5	0.4	
0.1	0.8	But
0.5	0.5	he
0.6	0	rallies.
0.3	0.6	
0.8	0.6	'I
0.9	0.6	seek
0.1	0.8	a

0.2	0.1	
0.9	0.1	Thus
0.8	0.9	far
0	0.7	the
0.1	0.7	busy
0.7	0.7	Captain
0.4	0.6	had
0.4	1	not

0.1	0.1	he
0.5	0	darts

0.6	0.7	
0.1	0.9	'We

0.5	0.8	slowly

0.5	0.9	
0.8	0.8	But

0.3	0.2	ere
0.1	0.3	the

0.4	0.6	
0.6	0.9	And
0.2	0.1	taken
0.1	0.7	with
0.6	0.7	the
0.4	1	context,
0.2	0.5	this
0.4	0.8	is
0.9	0.4	full
0.7	0.1	of
0.6	0.7	meaning.
0.4	0.1	
0.7	0.8	"Now
0.5	0.8	Jonah's
0.9	0.5	Captain,
0.4	0.6	shipmates,
0.1	0.9	was
0.2	0.6	one
0.8	0.7	whose
0.6	0.4	discernment
0.5	0.1	detects
0.5	0.1	crime
0.3	0.8	in
0.2	0.4	any,
0.4	0.4	but
0.9	0.4	whose
0.7	0.9	cupidity
0.4	0.8	exposes
0.2	0.6	it
0.2	0.7	only
0.3	0.4	in
0.2	0.5	the
0	0.7	penniless.
0.9	0.9	In
0.5	0.9	this
0.9	0.5	world,
0.5	0.2	shipmates,
0.1	0.2	sin
0.2	0.9	that
0.1	0.8	pays
0.8	0.1	its
0.1	0.9	way
0.3	0.9	can

0.8	0.9	
0.1	0.3	So
0.5	0.8	Jonah's
0.2	0.7	Captain
0.1	0.3	prepares
0.7	0.3	to

0.3	1	the

0.2	0.9	ere
0.5	0.9	he
0.3	0.2	judge
1	0.7	him
0.2	0.8	openly.
0	0.6	
0.5	0.6	He
0.2	0.1	charges
0.5	0.5	him
0.5	0.5	thrice
0.1	0.8	the
0.3	0.8	usual
0.4	0.1	sum;
0.4	0.1	and
1	0.3	it's
0.6	0.1	assented
0.7	0.5	to.
0.8	0.8	
0.9	0.1	Then
0.9	0.5	the
0	0.4	Captain
0.9	1	knows
0.9	1	that
0.4	0.3	Jonah
0.4	1	is
0.7	0.6	a
0	0.8	fugitive;
0.2	0.9	but
0.8	0.7	at
0.1	1	the
0	0.2	same
0.4	0.2	time
0.7	0.1	resolves
0.1	0.1	to

0.8	0.9	
0.2	0.8	Yet
0.3	1	when
0.2	0.5	Jonah
0.4	0.1	fairly
0.9	0.5	takes
1	1	out
0.1	0.4	his
0.4	1	purse,

0.5	0	the
0.3	0.9	Captain.
0.5	0	
0.8	0.4	He

0.7	0.2	Not

0.5	0.1	any

0.9	0.3	he

0.7	0.8	Jonah

0.4	0.4	now,

0.8	0.1	
0.1	0.2	'Thou
0.7	0.3	lookest

0.3	0.9	
0.8	0.6	Jonah
0.7	0.2	enters,
0.6	0.5	and
0.4	0.8	would
0.5	0.5	lock
1	1	the

0.5	0.6	but
0.5	0.7	the

1	0.2	
0.6	0.5	Hearing

0.4	0.7	foolishly
0.8	0.7	fumbling
0.1	0.5	there,
0.7	0.9	the

0.6	0.5	laughs
0.3	0.2	lowly
0.5	0.5	to
0.1	0.3	himself,
0.3	0.2	and
0.5	0.9	mutters
0.1	0.6	something

0.9	0.2	of

0.9	0.3	Jonah
0.1	0.5	throws

0.4	1	pretty
0.8	0.9	soon,
0.3	0.8	going
0.5	0.9	to
0.4	0.1	the
0.3	0.2	table,
0.6	0.4	took
0.8	0.7	up
0.1	0.8	a
0.4	0.2	large
0.6	0.8	book
0.1	0.1	there,
0.4	0.2	and
0.3	0.1	placing
0.2	0.5	it
0.3	0.5	on
0.6	0.3	his
0.5	0.9	lap
0.9	0	began
0.4	0.3	counting
1	0.4	the
0	0.9	pages
0.4	0.2	with
0.2	0.3	deliberate
0.6	0.9	regularity;
0.3	0.8	at
0.5	0.4	every
0.3	0.8	fiftieth
0.8	0.5	page--as
0.5	1	I
0.5	0.4	fancied--stopping
0.3	0.2	a
0.3	0.5	moment,
0.2	0.5	looking
0.7	0.3	vacantly
0	0.3	around
0.4	0.4	him,
0.8	0.6	and
0.1	0.2	giving
1	0.8	utterance
0.9	0.2	to
0	0.1	a
0.8	0.2	long-drawn
0.6	0.5	gurgling
1	0.5	whistle
0.1	0.3	of
0.5	1	astonishment.
0.9	0.3	
0.6	0.2	He
0.8	0.6	would
0.1	0.3	then
0.6	0.8	begin
0.9	0.1	again
0.1	0.8	at
0.1	0.6	the
0.6	0.6	next
0.5	0.1	fifty;
1	0.4	seeming
0.5	0.6	to
0.1	0.9	commence
0.6	0.6	at
0.2	0.8	number
0.6	0.3	one
0.7	0.4	each
0.8	0.4	time,
0.9	0.1	as
0.7	0.7	though
0	1	he
0.3	0.6	could
0.8	0.1	not
0.9	0.2	count
0.9	0.8	more
0.2	0.4	than
0.2	0.7	fifty,
0.9	0.8	and
0.9	0	it
0.2	0.3	was
0.3	0.4	only
0.4	0.7	by
0.6	0.2	such
0.7	0	a
0.5	0.1	large
0.4	0.3	number
0	0.3	of
0.7	0.1	fifties
0.1	0.1	being
0.1	0.7	found
0.5	0.3	together,
0	0.9	that
0.4	0.7	his
0.1	0.8	astonishment
0.4	0.9	at
0.3	0.4	the
0.6	0.3	multitude
0.8	0.7	of
1	0.3	pages
0.9	0.2	was
0.7	0.3	excited.
0.5	0.8	
0.2	0.2	With
0.3	0.8	much
0.7	0.5	interest
0.3	0.7	I
0.8	0.1	sat
0.1	0.4	watching
0.6	0.6	him.
0.1	0.5	
0.7	0.6	Savage
0.5	0.7	though
0.6	1	he
0.4	0.1	was,
0.2	0.7	and
0.6	0.5	hideously
0.1	0.4	marred
0.4	1	about
0.7	0.2	the
0.8	0.2	face--at
0.9	0.6	least
0.9	0.7	to
0.3	0.3	my
0.1	0.5	taste--his
0.5	0.4	countenance
0.4	0.3	yet
0.8	0.9	had
0.5	0.9	a
0.2	0.1	something
0.7	0.6	in
0.7	0.4	it
0.7	0.5	which
0.6	0.7	was
0.6	0.9	by
0.3	0.2	no
0.2	0.1	means
0.8	1	disagreeable.
0.8	0.6	
0.6	0.6	You
0.6	0.7	cannot
0.1	0.7	hide
0	0.1	the
0.1	0.3	soul.
0.4	0.5	
0.1	0.6	Through
0.8	0.1	all
0.3	0.2	his
0.5	0	unearthly
0.6	0.7	tattooings,
0.2	0.4	I
0.4	0.4	thought
0.1	0.4	I
1	0.5	saw
0.1	0.7	the
0.8	0.1	traces
0.2	0	of
0.2	0.5	a
0.6	0.7	simple
0.9	0.9	honest
0.9	0.1	heart;
0.3	0.6	and
0.1	0.4	in
0.6	0.6	his
0.3	0.6	large,
0.2	0.2	deep
0.4	0.7	eyes,
0.8	0.6	fiery
0.1	1	black
0.6	0.5	and
0.6	1	bold,
0.5	0.7	there
0.9	0.9	seemed
0.3	1	tokens
0.4	0.9	of
0.6	0.6	a
0.6	0.4	spirit
0.2	0.1	that
0.5	0.2	would
0.6	0.5	dare
0.8	0.2	a
0	0.4	thousand
0.9	0.5	devils.
0.3	0.3	
0.7	0.6	And
0.4	0.7	besides
0.1	0.8	all
1	0.4	this,
0.5	0.6	there
0.4	0.1	was
0.3	0.1	a
0.3	0.3	certain
0	0.8	lofty
0.2	0.7	bearing
1	0.2	about
0.7	0	the
0.5	0.1	Pagan,
0.2	0.5	which
0.1	0.9	even
0.9	0.9	his
0	1	uncouthness
0.4	0.1	could
0.9	0.6	not
0.6	0.2	altogether
0.9	0.5	maim.
0.6	0.9	
0.4	0.9	He
0	0.5	looked
0.6	0.6	like
0.8	0.1	a
0.1	0.4	man
1	0.1	who
1	0.6	had
0.1	0.9	never
0.2	0.1	cringed
0.3	0.3	and
0.5	0.8	never
0.9	0	had
0.8	0.1	had
0.3	0.6	a
0.7	0.8	creditor.
0.8	0.7	
0.6	0.1	Whether
0.9	0	it
0.6	0	was,
0.6	0.4	too,
0.1	0.2	that
0.8	0.8	his
0.2	0.1	head
0.3	0.8	being
0.5	0.1	shaved,
0.2	0.8	his
0.9	0.5	forehead
0.7	0.9	was
0.3	0.3	drawn
0.6	0.6	out
0.6	0.8	in
0.7	0.8	freer
0.7	0.7	and
0.2	0.9	brighter
0.1	0.6	relief,
0.9	0.6	and
0.5	0.9	looked
0.1	0.1	more
0.4	0.2	expansive
0.4	0.3	than
0.8	0.1	it
0.9	0.2	otherwise
0.7	0.9	would,
1	0.5	this
0.7	1	I
0.6	0.7	will
0.7	0.6	not
0	0.2	venture
0.3	0.8	to
0.9	0.2	decide;
0.2	0.3	but
0.5	0.5	certain
0.9	0.5	it
0.7	0.8	was
0.7	0.2	his
0.9	0.8	head
0.3	0.8	was
0.3	0.9	phrenologically
0.3	0.2	an
0.3	0.7	excellent
0.7	0.5	one.
0.7	1	
0.5	0.5	It
0.4	0.4	may
0.7	0.5	seem
0.9	0.8	ridiculous,
0.9	0.2	but
0.5	0.7	it
0.2	0.2	reminded
0.2	0.8	me
0.6	0.7	of
0.1	0.1	General
0.9	0.8	Washington's
0.2	0.3	head,
0.8	0.1	as
0	0.8	seen
0.7	0.3	in
0.8	0.9	the
0.1	0.2	popular
0.5	0.4	busts
0.9	0.8	of
0.3	0.2	him.
0.7	0	
0.3	0.5	It
0.4	0.5	had
0.8	0.9	the
0.7	0.6	same
0.5	0.4	long
0.9	0.8	regularly
0.4	0.7	graded
0.5	0.6	retreating
0.2	0.1	slope
0.9	0.1	from
0.2	0.9	above
0.5	0.1	the
0.1	0.7	brows,
0.4	0.3	which
0.9	0.9	were
0.8	0.1	likewise
0.3	0.3	very
0	0.3	projecting,
0.8	0.3	like
0.4	0.7	two
0.7	0.5	long
0.8	0.3	promontories
0.3	0.4	thickly
0	0.1	wooded
0.6	0.3	on
0.2	1	top.
0.3	0.7	
0.2	0.8	Queequeg
1	0.1	was
0.4	0.6	George
0.6	0.5	Washington
0.9	0.3	cannibalistically
0.2	0.6	developed.
0.8	0.8	
0.6	0.3	Whilst
0	0.2	I
0.2	0.8	was
0.2	0.3	thus
0.3	0.4	closely
0.9	0.4	scanning
0.8	0.7	him,
0	0.7	half-pretending
0.4	0.9	meanwhile
1	0.8	to
0.4	0.1	be
0.3	0.3	looking
0.9	0.7	out
0.3	0.6	at
0.7	0	the
0.3	0.1	storm
0	0.8	from
0.7	0.1	the
0.3	0.7	casement,
0.7	0.7	he
1	0.5	never
0.6	0.6	heeded
0.4	0.1	my
0.5	1	presence,
0.9	0.4	never
0.6	0.2	troubled
0.3	0.2	himself
0.3	0.4	with
0.5	0.8	so
0.1	1	much
0.5	0.2	as
0.8	0.7	a
0.3	1	single
0.3	0.2	glance;
0	0.7	but
0.7	0.2	appeared
0.6	0.4	wholly
0.9	0.2	occupied
0.2	0.7	with
0.7	0.8	counting
0.7	0.1	the
0.9	0.7	pages
0.9	0.4	of
1	0.1	the
0.3	0.7	marvellous
0.9	0.8	book.
0.9	0.8	
0.8	0.4	Considering
0.1	0.1	how
0.9	0.6	sociably
0.1	0.1	we
0.9	0.8	had
0.6	0.8	been
0.5	0.8	sleeping
0.1	0.4	together
0.3	0	the
0.5	0.5	night
0.3	0.9	previous,
0	0.2	and
0.6	0.2	especially
0.2	0.5	considering
0.1	0.6	the
0.3	0.7	affectionate
0.8	0.8	arm
0.1	0.4	I
0.1	0.5	had
0.7	0.7	found
0.3	0.9	thrown
0.3	0.2	over
0.6	0.5	me
1	0	upon
0	0.2	waking
0.7	0.4	in
0	0.1	the
1	0.4	morning,
0.3	0.4	I
0.4	0.6	thought
0.3	0	this
0.7	0.5	indifference
0.3	0.7	of
0.1	0.4	his
0.7	0.9	very
0.4	0.8	strange.
0.8	0	
0.3	0.1	But
0.8	0.6	savages
0.6	0.8	are
0.3	0.3	strange
0.7	0.9	beings;
0.5	0.5	at
0	0.1	times
0.1	0.9	you
0.2	0.3	do
0.6	0.3	not
0.8	0.4	know
0.2	0.1	exactly
0	0.2	how
0.1	0.8	to
0.9	0.4	take
0.1	0.1	them.
0.2	0.2	
0.3	0.8	At
0.4	0.7	first
0.8	0	they
0.7	0.8	are
0.7	0.8	overawing;
0.2	0.3	their
0.7	0.2	calm
0.8	0	self-collectedness
0.3	0.8	of
0.8	0.1	simplicity
0.5	0.6	seems
0.3	0.7	a
0	0.5	Socratic
0.4	0.8	wisdom.
0.6	0.8	
0.4	0.9	I
0.1	0.7	had
0.4	0.7	noticed
0.6	0.6	also
0.1	0.4	that
0.5	0.3	Queequeg
0.3	0.7	never
0.6	0.5	consorted
0.9	0.7	at
0.1	0.9	all,
0.5	0.8	or
0.8	1	but
0.3	0.8	very
0.3	0.6	little,
0.7	0.1	with
0.2	0.6	the
0.3	0.1	other
0.6	0.4	seamen
0.4	0.7	in
0.6	0.4	the
0.4	0.5	inn.
0.1	0.2	
0.9	0.1	He
0.9	0.7	made
0.8	0.9	no
0.8	0.5	advances
0.9	0.9	whatever;
0.1	0.4	appeared
0.8	0.4	to
0.6	0.4	have
0.2	0.4	no
0.6	0.5	desire
0.1	0.6	to
0	0.4	enlarge
0.2	0.4	the
0.5	0.2	circle
0.8	0.7	of
0.6	0.4	his
0.8	0.9	acquaintances.
0.2	0.8	
0.6	0.3	All
0.3	0.4	this
0.1	0.6	struck
0.6	0.8	me
0.4	1	as
0.5	0.2	mighty
0.9	0.3	singular;
1	0.3	yet,
0.7	0.8	upon
0.8	0.5	second
0.8	0.8	thoughts,
0.8	0.5	there
0.7	0.4	was
0.9	0.2	something
0.6	0.1	almost
0.6	1	sublime
0.5	0	in
0.1	0.7	it.
1	0.3	Here
0.8	0.4	was
0.5	0.6	a
0.2	0.7	man
0.3	0.9	some
0.4	0.8	twenty
0.6	0.5	thousand
0.6	0.3	miles
0.6	0.9	from
0.4	0.3	home,
0.7	0.4	by
0.7	0.2	the
0.1	0.4	way
0.6	0.2	of
0.7	0.6	Cape
0.1	0.4	Horn,
0.6	0.3	that
1	0.8	is--which
0.2	0.5	was
0.9	0.4	the
0.2	0.2	only
0.4	0	way
0.8	0.3	he
0.2	0.8	could
0.9	0.9	get
1	0.8	there--thrown
0.2	0	among
0.3	0.5	people
0.4	0.8	as
0.6	1	strange
0.1	0.2	to
0.7	0.6	him
0.3	0.7	as
0.9	0.2	though
0.4	0.1	he
0.7	0	were
0.3	0.4	in
0.8	0.3	the
0.1	0.4	planet
0.2	0.7	Jupiter;
0.7	0.4	and
0.1	0.8	yet
0.2	0.4	he
0.7	0.7	seemed
0.6	0.3	entirely
0.8	1	at
1	0.7	his
0.1	0.1	ease;
0.7	0.8	preserving
0.4	0.4	the
0.1	0.3	utmost
0.2	0.6	serenity;
0.2	0.2	content
0.5	0.4	with
0	0.9	his
0.8	0.4	own
0.3	0.9	companionship;
0.2	0.1	always
0.9	0.8	equal
0.3	0.4	to
0.6	0.9	himself.
0.2	0.4	
0.7	0.3	Surely
0.4	0.1	this
0.7	1	was
0.5	0	a
0.3	0.7	touch
0.8	0.1	of
0.2	0.2	fine
1	0.4	philosophy;
0.5	0.1	though
0.7	0.1	no
0.7	0.4	doubt
0.9	0.5	he
1	0.9	had
0.6	0	never
0.3	0.3	heard
0.9	0	there
0.3	0.3	was
1	0.7	such
0.2	0.6	a
0.1	0.1	thing
0.8	0.8	as
0.6	1	that.
0.5	1	
0.4	0.9	But,
0.5	0.6	perhaps,
0	0.9	to
0.7	0.8	be
0.1	0.7	true
0.1	0.2	philosophers,
0.5	0.8	we
0.6	0.3	mortals
0.2	0.5	should
0.6	0.7	not
0.3	0.3	be
0	0.3	conscious
0.4	0.4	of
0.7	0.3	so
1	0.1	living
0	0.6	or
0.6	0.9	so
0.9	0.6	striving.
0.4	0.6	
0	0.4	So
0.6	0.1	soon
0.5	0.4	as
0.9	0.6	I
0.7	0.2	hear
0.9	0.5	that
0.8	0.2	such
0.5	0.7	or
0.2	0.6	such
0.5	0.7	a
0.3	0.6	man
0.5	0.2	gives
0.9	0.2	himself
0.8	0.8	out
0	0.5	for
0.3	0.1	a
0.6	0.1	philosopher,
0.5	0.4	I
0.2	0	conclude
0.3	0.8	that,
0.1	0.7	like
0.6	0.7	the
0.9	0.5	dyspeptic
0.8	0.9	old
0.3	0.6	woman,
0.1	0.4	he
0.2	0.5	must
0	0	have
0.9	0.9	"broken
0.6	0.8	his
0.2	0.5	digester."
0.6	0.7	
0.8	0.3	As
0.7	0.6	I
0.9	0.4	sat
0.7	0.9	there
0.7	0.2	in
0.1	0.8	that
1	0.2	now
1	0.6	lonely
0.1	0.9	room;
0.6	0	the
0.1	0.5	fire
0.3	0.8	burning
0.3	0.3	low,
0.6	0.4	in
0.9	0.3	that
0.6	0.7	mild
1	0.5	stage
0.9	0.2	when,
0.4	0.1	after
0.1	0.2	its
0.8	0.7	first
0.3	1	intensity
0.5	0.3	has
0.1	0.4	warmed
0.3	0.2	the
0.9	0	air,
0.1	0.9	it
0.8	0.2	then
0.4	0.5	only
0.5	0.2	glows
0.9	0.4	to
0.6	0.1	be
0.1	0.7	looked
0.5	0.2	at;
0.5	0.8	the
0.1	0.1	evening
0.9	0.8	shades
0.2	0.8	and
0.3	0.1	phantoms
0.9	0.5	gathering
0.6	0.3	round

0.7	0.8	in

0.6	0.6	silent,
0.3	0.1	solitary
0.6	0.1	twain;

0.5	0.1	storm
0.9	0.3	booming
0.3	0.2	without
0.8	0.1	in
0.9	0.7	solemn
0.3	0.5	swells;
0.8	0.9	I
0.2	0.4	began
0.3	0.7	to
0.8	0.1	be
0.1	0.4	sensible
0.5	0.5	of
0.6	0.7	strange
0.8	0.9	feelings.
0.3	0.7	
0.3	0.3	I
0.1	0.9	felt
0.7	0.9	a
0.9	0.3	melting
0.8	1	in
0.5	0.8	me.
0.8	0.7	
0.8	1	No
0.7	0.8	more
0.3	0.1	my
0.2	0.5	splintered
0.4	0.9	heart
1	0.5	and
0.4	0.6	maddened
0.8	1	hand
1	0.8	were
0.4	0.3	turned
0.3	0.9	against
0.8	0.7	the
0.4	0.3	wolfish
0.1	1	world.
0.7	0.6	
0.6	0.6	This
0.4	0.1	soothing
0.9	1	savage
0.1	0.5	had
0.9	0.8	redeemed
0	0.8	it.
0.1	0.6	
0.9	0.6	There
0.4	0.7	he
0.4	0.7	sat,
0.3	0.5	his
0.6	0.1	very
0.7	1	indifference
0.2	0.1	speaking
0.7	0.6	a
0.1	0.9	nature
0.1	0.8	in
0.3	0.7	which
0.4	0.9	there
0.7	0.8	lurked
0.2	0.8	no
0.1	0.4	civilized
0.9	0.6	hypocrisies
0.5	0.9	and
0.4	0.4	bland
0.9	0.4	deceits.
0.7	0.3	
0.4	0.4	Wild
0.7	0.5	he
0.6	0	was;
0.1	0.3	a
0.3	0.1	very
0.7	0.3	sight
0.1	0.8	of
0.8	0.7	sights
0.3	0.5	to
0.1	0.8	see;
0.2	0.5	yet
0.1	0.2	I
0.3	0.1	began
0.3	0.5	to
0.1	0.8	feel
0.5	0.1	myself
0.3	1	mysteriously
0.1	0.9	drawn
0.7	0.6	towards
0.3	0.1	him.
0.6	0.7	And
0.5	0.5	those
0.5	0.4	same
1	0.9	things
0.4	0.3	that
0.4	1	would
0	0.3	have
0.1	0.8	repelled
0.7	0	most
0.4	1	others,
0.9	0.3	they
0.7	0.7	were
0.1	0.9	the
0.5	0.2	very
0.4	1	magnets
0	0.7	that
0.9	0.9	thus
0.1	0.2	drew
0.8	0.5	me.
0.8	0.3	
0.1	0.8	I'll
0.5	0.1	try
0.2	0.8	a
0.1	0.8	pagan
0.5	0.1	friend,
0.8	0.6	thought
0.2	0.7	I,
0.1	0.4	since
0.8	0.9	Christian
0.9	0.1	kindness
0.5	0.2	has
0.2	0.3	proved
0.5	0.4	but
0.9	1	hollow
0.9	0.5	courtesy.
0.8	0.1	
0.8	0.6	I
0.7	0.7	drew
0.3	0.2	my
0.4	0.1	bench
0.7	0.7	near
0.4	0.8	him,
0.3	0.3	and
0.1	0.6	made
0.4	0.8	some
0.3	0.7	friendly
0.5	0.6	signs
0.8	0	and
0.5	0.4	hints,
0.1	0.3	doing
0.2	0.8	my
0.5	0	best
0.1	0.6	to
0.5	0	talk
0.1	0.6	with
0.4	0.7	him
0.5	0.2	meanwhile.
0.2	0.2	
0	0.3	At
0.9	0.5	first
0.6	0.7	he
0.5	0.7	little
0.5	0.6	noticed
0.1	1	these
0.7	0.9	advances;
0.2	0.2	but
0.2	0.5	presently,
0.6	0	upon
0.2	0.5	my
0.9	0.4	referring
0.2	0.1	to
0.8	0.1	his
0.6	0	last
0.2	0.2	night's
0.2	0.4	hospitalities,
0.2	0.2	he
0.7	0.1	made
0.2	0.3	out
0.2	1	to
0.3	0.7	ask
0.3	0.7	me
0.3	0	whether
0.9	1	we
0.9	0.6	were
0.6	0.6	again
0.6	0.8	to
0.1	0.2	be
1	0.7	bedfellows.
0.6	0.6	
0.6	0.4	I
0.4	0.6	told
0.4	0.6	him
0.4	0.8	yes;
0.2	0.2	whereat
0.3	0.6	I
0.8	0.8	thought
0.7	0.4	he
0.3	0.7	looked
0.8	0.8	pleased,
0.2	0.9	perhaps
0.3	0.7	a
0.4	0	little
0.3	0	complimented.
0.2	0.3	
0.3	0.1	We
0.8	0.5	then
0.7	0.2	turned
0.1	0.8	over
0.8	0.2	the
0.8	0.6	book
0.8	0.8	together,
0.4	1	and
0.3	0.7	I
0.8	0.2	endeavored
0.1	0.3	to
0.7	0	explain
0.3	0.2	to
0.6	0.6	him
0.4	0.5	the
0.7	0.2	purpose
0.1	0	of
0.5	0.9	the
0.9	0.6	printing,
0.7	0.8	and
0.1	0.5	the
0.8	0.2	meaning
0.9	0.2	of
0.5	0.4	the
0.6	0.4	few
0.2	0.2	pictures
0	0.6	that
0.5	0.6	were
0.7	0.5	in
0.7	0.2	it.
0	0.7	
0.1	0.2	Thus
0.3	0.7	I
0.1	0.7	soon
0.9	1	engaged
0.9	0	his
0.9	0.9	interest;
1	0.8	and
0.7	0.3	from
0.3	0.4	that
0.5	0.1	we
1	0.7	went
0.1	0.5	to
0.3	0.1	jabbering
0.5	0.1	the
0.7	0.3	best
0.4	0.7	we
0.6	0.1	could
1	0.1	about
0.5	0.2	the
0.3	0.4	various
0.7	0.2	outer
0.8	0.5	sights
0.6	0.5	to
0.2	0.9	be
0	0.4	seen
0.8	0.1	in
0.4	0.1	this
0.3	0.7	famous
0.5	0.6	town.
0	0	
0	0.4	Soon
0.1	0.6	I
0.9	0.7	proposed
0.6	0.1	a
0	0.5	social
1	0.4	smoke;
0.8	0.4	and,
1	0.6	producing
0	0.3	his
0.2	0.3	pouch
0.6	0.2	and
0.2	0.6	tomahawk,
0.8	0.7	he
0.3	0	quietly
0.3	0.6	offered
0.4	0.7	me
0.4	0.1	a
0.1	0.9	puff.
0.9	0.9	
0.6	0.5	And
0.1	0.5	then
0	0.4	we
0.2	0.9	sat
0.3	0.9	exchanging
0.1	0.1	puffs
1	1	from
0.7	0.8	that
0.1	0.4	wild
0.1	0.1	pipe
0.3	0.8	of
0.3	0.8	his,
1	0.3	and
0.4	0.7	keeping
0.9	1	it
0.8	0.8	regularly
0.7	0.5	passing
0.5	0.1	between
0	0.5	us.
0.9	0.9	
0.4	0.8	If
0.9	0.2	there
0.5	0.3	yet
0.2	0.3	lurked
0.6	0.9	any
0.1	0.6	ice
0.5	0.5	of
0.3	0.3	indifference
0.9	0.3	towards
0.2	0.3	me
0.2	0.3	in
1	0.6	the
0.1	0.5	Pagan's
0.7	0.6	breast,
0.8	0.3	this
0.1	0.5	pleasant,
0.5	1	genial
0.8	0.8	smoke
0.7	0.8	we
0.1	0.1	had,
0.1	1	soon
0.6	0.6	thawed
0.1	0.3	it
0.8	0.9	out,
0.4	0.4	and
0.1	0.1	left
0.7	0.2	us
0.9	0.9	cronies.
0.5	0.1	
0.6	0.8	He
0.3	0	seemed
0.8	0.7	to
0.2	0.1	take
0.3	0.7	to
0.8	0.9	me
0.7	0.8	quite
0.8	0.4	as
0.9	0.7	naturally
0.2	0.2	and
0.3	0.6	unbiddenly
0.1	0.6	as
0.4	0.7	I
0.4	0.1	to
0.7	0.6	him;
0.6	0.3	and
0.9	1	when
0.7	0.8	our
0.3	0.1	smoke
0.3	0.2	was
0.1	0.1	over,
0.2	0.3	he
0.4	0.3	pressed
0.7	0	his
0	0.8	forehead
0.3	0.6	against
0.5	1	mine,
0.3	0.2	clasped
0.6	0.4	me
0.7	0.7	round
0.6	0.6	the
0.6	0.8	waist,
0.4	0.6	and
0.8	0.5	said
0.4	0.3	that
0	0.2	henceforth
0.4	0.5	we
0.3	0.9	were
0.3	0.7	married;
0.4	1	meaning,
0.8	0.1	in
0.1	0.3	his
0.7	0.3	country's
1	0.5	phrase,
0.5	0.1	that
0.2	0.7	we
0	0.5	were
0.3	0.5	bosom
0.3	0.4	friends;
0.8	0.4	he
0.4	0.2	would
0.9	0.3	gladly
0.7	0.9	die
1	0.1	for
0.8	0.1	me,
0.9	0.7	if
0.2	0.5	need
0.7	0.5	should
0.3	0.1	be.
0.9	0.6	In
0.9	0.6	a
0	0.6	countryman,
0.8	0.8	this
0.8	0.2	sudden
0.9	0.1	flame
0.8	0.5	of
0.9	0.9	friendship
0.2	0.5	would
0.2	0.2	have
0.9	0.4	seemed
0.1	0.9	far
0.1	0.2	too
0.1	0	premature,
0.8	0.6	a
0.2	0.9	thing
0.3	0	to
0.1	0.5	be
0.8	0.5	much
0.3	1	distrusted;
0.2	0.5	but
0.8	0.7	in
0.8	0.1	this
0.3	0.7	simple
0.2	0.4	savage
0.2	0.8	those
0.8	0.2	old
0.9	0.9	rules
0.3	0.9	would
0.5	0.4	not
0.7	0.9	apply.
1	0.5	
0.1	0.9	After
0.1	0.8	supper,
1	0.2	and
0.3	0.7	another
0.4	0.5	social
0.6	0.8	chat
0.7	0.7	and
0.3	0.1	smoke,
0.8	0.2	we
0.4	0.2	went
0.3	0.6	to
0	0.3	our
0.9	0.6	room
0.7	0.5	together.
0.1	0.5	
0.2	0.7	He
0.5	0.5	made
0.7	0.8	me
0.6	0.6	a
0.6	0	present
0.8	0.7	of
0.2	0.8	his
0.9	0.3	embalmed
0.2	0.5	head;
1	0.1	took
0.5	0.3	out
0	0.9	his
0.6	0.8	enormous
0.6	0.6	tobacco
0.3	1	wallet,
0.2	0.8	and
0.5	0.1	groping
0.6	0.2	under
0.3	0.5	the
0.9	0.1	tobacco,
0.6	0	drew
0.5	0.5	out
0.3	0.8	some
0	0.7	thirty
0.8	0.9	dollars
0.3	0.3	in
0.6	0	silver;
0.5	0.6	then
0.3	0.3	spreading
0	0.9	them
0.4	1	on
0.6	0.1	the
0.1	0.9	table,
0	0.1	and
0.6	0.9	mechanically
0.9	0.7	dividing
0.4	0.6	them
0.5	0.5	into
0.4	0.8	two
0.7	0.9	equal
0.2	0.7	portions,
0.6	0.7	pushed
0.1	0.6	one
0.8	0.6	of
0.8	0.6	them
0	0.3	towards
0	0.9	me,
0.6	0.4	and
0.1	0.4	said
1	0	it
0.4	1	was
0	0.1	mine.
1	0.3	
0.7	0.3	I
0.9	0.7	was
0.2	0.8	going
0.1	0.7	to
0.2	0.1	remonstrate;
0.3	0.4	but
0.6	0.5	he
0.1	0.4	silenced
0.4	0.2	me
0.9	0.7	by
0.6	0.7	pouring
0.3	1	them
0.5	1	into
1	0.6	my
0.6	0.9	trowsers'
0.4	0.5	pockets.
0.9	0.8	
0.4	0.1	I
0.6	1	let
0.9	0.5	them
0.3	0.6	stay.
0.5	0.3	
0.8	0.2	He
0.8	0.1	then
0.5	0.6	went
0.5	0.3	about
0.3	0.8	his
0.8	0.5	evening
0.4	0.7	prayers,
0.5	0.6	took
0.7	1	out
0.5	0	his
0.5	0.1	idol,
0.2	0.7	and
0.9	0.3	removed
0.2	0.7	the
0.8	0.3	paper
0.5	0.1	fireboard.
0.1	0.9	
0.3	0.8	By
0.3	0.3	certain
1	0.5	signs
0.4	0.6	and
0.3	0.7	symptoms,
0.2	0.9	I
0.8	0.8	thought
0.4	0.4	he
0.9	0.3	seemed
0.8	0.7	anxious
0.7	0.1	for
0.9	0.7	me
0.1	1	to
0.3	0.2	join
0.8	0.6	him;
0.5	0.7	but
1	0.1	well
0.5	0.1	knowing
0.3	0.8	what
0.4	0.8	was
0.5	0	to
0.2	0.4	follow,
0.5	0.1	I
0.5	0.5	deliberated
0.5	0.4	a
0.3	0.8	moment
0.5	0.8	whether,
0.1	0.5	in
0.1	0.3	case
0.7	0.2	he
0.7	0.7	invited
0.7	1	me,
0.4	0.4	I
0.8	0.5	would
0.2	0.9	comply
0.3	0.8	or
0.4	0.5	otherwise.
0.1	0.6	
0.7	0.3	I
0.9	0.1	was
0.6	0.5	a
0.3	0.3	good
0.4	0.6	Christian;
0.7	0.6	born
0.7	0.5	and
0.2	0.7	bred
0.8	0.2	in
0.1	0.3	the
0.8	0.6	bosom
0.5	0.7	of
0.6	0.4	the
0.3	0.8	infallible
0.5	0.9	Presbyterian
0.5	0.1	Church.
0.9	0.2	
0.4	0.1	How
0.9	0.6	then
0.7	0.9	could
0.5	0.2	I
0.4	0.3	unite
1	0.3	with
0.9	0.4	this
0.7	0	wild
0.6	1	idolator
0.1	0.8	in
0.3	0.6	worshipping
0.3	0.3	his
0.1	0.8	piece
0	1	of
0.2	0.2	wood?
0.1	0.5	
0.4	0.2	But
0.8	0.8	what
0.4	0.2	is
0.4	0.8	worship?
0.4	0.7	thought
0.3	0.5	I.
0.4	0.8	Do
0.9	0	you
0.6	0.3	suppose
0.8	0.9	now,
0.3	0.7	Ishmael,
0.1	0.6	that
0.3	0	the
0.3	0.7	magnanimous
0.8	0.7	God
0.3	0.7	of
0.9	0.1	heaven
0.4	1	and
0.6	0.9	earth--pagans
0.2	0.4	and
0.1	0.5	all
1	0.5	included--can
0.7	0.6	possibly
0.8	0.3	be
0.3	0.6	jealous
1	0.7	of
0.1	0.5	an
0.6	0.4	insignificant
0.3	0.4	bit
0.9	0.9	of
0.7	0.8	black
0.2	0.7	wood?
1	0	
0.6	0.8	Impossible!
0.4	0.1	
0.3	0.8	But
0.4	0.8	what
0.9	0.1	is
0.4	0.3	worship?--to
0.1	0.8	do
1	0.9	the
0.6	0.1	will
0.2	0.3	of
0.7	0.3	God--THAT
0.6	0.8	is
0.9	0.5	worship.
0.3	0.2	
0.2	0.7	And
0.3	0	what
0.3	0.7	is
0.1	0.9	the
0	0	will
1	0.7	of
0.8	0.1	God?--to
0.6	0.9	do
0.6	0.9	to
0.9	0.3	my
0	0.9	fellow
0.6	0.6	man
0.6	0.5	what
0	0.6	I
0.5	0.8	would
0.3	0.2	have
0.2	0.5	my
0.7	1	fellow
0.7	0.1	man
0.1	0.1	to
0.5	0.9	do
0.2	0.2	to
0.5	0.4	me--THAT
0.2	0.5	is
0.7	0.8	the
0	0.5	will
0.2	0.8	of
0.3	0.1	God.
0.5	0.9	
0.1	0.4	Now,
0.2	0.6	Queequeg
0.3	0.4	is
0.4	0.3	my
0.9	0.3	fellow
0.6	0.4	man.
0.8	0.4	
0.5	0.5	And
0.2	0.6	what
0.8	0.6	do
0.2	0.3	I
0.5	1	wish
0	0.6	that
0.3	0.7	this
0.2	0.9	Queequeg
0.8	0.4	would
0.6	0.9	do
0.7	0	to
0.2	0.6	me?
0.8	0.9	
0.8	0.1	Why,
0.4	0.1	unite
0.5	0.6	with
0.8	0.6	me
0.8	0.8	in
0.6	0.4	my
1	0.5	particular
0.8	0.3	Presbyterian
0.8	0.1	form
0.1	0.7	of
0.5	0.8	worship.
0.4	0.7	Consequently,
0.5	0.9	I
0.8	0.6	must
1	1	then
0.2	0.3	unite
0.8	0.3	with
1	0.5	him
0.4	0.2	in
0.8	0.5	his;
0.8	0.4	ergo,
0.7	0.4	I
0.2	0.8	must
0.5	0.8	turn
0.8	0.6	idolator.
0.7	0.4	
0.3	0.7	So
0.9	0.6	I
0.8	0.1	kindled
0.9	0.5	the
0	0.5	shavings;
0.1	1	helped
0.4	0.2	prop
0.9	0.1	up
0	0.8	the
0.9	0.6	innocent
1	0.7	little
0.5	1	idol;
0.1	0.7	offered
1	0.6	him
0.3	0.8	burnt
0.8	1	biscuit
0.9	0.1	with
0.9	0.7	Queequeg;
0.9	0.4	salamed
0.3	0.7	before
0.8	0.4	him
0.6	0.1	twice
0.4	0.6	or
0.8	0.7	thrice;
0.1	0.1	kissed
0.5	0.6	his
0.9	0.6	nose;
0.9	0.4	and
0.8	0.1	that
0.5	0.8	done,
0.6	0.1	we
0.8	0.5	undressed
0.2	0.5	and
0.5	0.8	went
0.9	1	to
0.2	0.2	bed,
0.5	1	at
0.5	0.2	peace
1	0.4	with
0.5	0.7	our
0.2	0.3	own
0.3	0.2	consciences
0.5	0	and
0.8	0.6	all
0.6	0.6	the
0.8	0.2	world.
0.2	0.9	But
0.7	0.3	we
0.7	0.9	did
0.5	0.3	not
0.7	0.4	go
0.9	0.2	to
0.7	0	sleep
0.1	1	without
1	0.9	some
0.1	0.4	little
0.1	0.1	chat.
0.6	0.2	
0.8	0.1	How
0.1	0.5	it
0.5	0.3	is
0	1	I
0.4	0.3	know
0.9	0.4	not;
0.2	0.1	but
0	0.7	there
0.8	0.9	is
0.3	0.6	no
0.3	0	place
0.8	0.4	like
1	0.3	a
0.8	0.8	bed
0.7	0.6	for
0.9	0.8	confidential
0.4	0.8	disclosures
0.9	0.4	between
0.5	0	friends.
0.5	0.8	
0.1	0.9	Man
0	0.5	and
0.9	0.3	wife,
0.1	0.5	they
0.4	0.4	say,
0.6	0.8	there
0.7	0.9	open
1	0.4	the
0	0.5	very
1	0.8	bottom
0.3	0.8	of
0.4	0.1	their
0.8	0.1	souls
0.2	0.3	to
0.6	0.3	each
0.5	1	other;
0	0.4	and
0.3	0.8	some
0.6	0.3	old
0.4	0.3	couples
0.2	1	often
0.9	0.6	lie
0.4	0.6	and
0.6	0.6	chat
0.8	0.9	over
0.6	0.8	old
0.8	0	times
0.2	0.8	till
0.1	0.3	nearly
0.4	0.7	morning.
0.4	0.3	
0.3	0.5	Thus,
0.4	0.6	then,
0.7	0.9	in
0.4	0.8	our
0.3	0.6	hearts'
1	0.6	honeymoon,
1	0.5	lay
0.5	1	I
0.5	0.9	and
0.1	0.7	Queequeg--a
0.4	1	cosy,
0.5	0.6	loving
0.8	0.6	pair.

0.8	0.4	
0.2	0.3	
0.3	0.8	We
0.8	0.3	had
0.6	0.2	lain
0.3	0.7	thus
0.1	0.5	in
0.3	0.2	bed,
0.4	0.3	chatting
0.5	0.8	and
0.1	0.3	napping
0.9	0.1	at
0.3	0.7	short
0.6	0.6	intervals,
0.2	0.6	and
0.4	0.9	Queequeg
0.2	0.1	now
0.5	0.8	and
0.8	0.6	then
0.2	0.9	affectionately
0.5	0.9	throwing
0.7	0.4	his
0.1	0.5	brown
0.9	0.5	tattooed
0.8	0.6	legs
0.3	0.1	over
0.1	0.7	mine,
0.9	0.1	and
0.2	0.1	then
0.8	0.7	drawing
0.5	1	them
0.7	0.4	back;
0.8	0.4	so
0.6	0.7	entirely
1	0.4	sociable
0.7	0.2	and
0.6	0.7	free
0.3	0.7	and
0.4	0.3	easy
0.9	1	were
0.5	0.6	we;
0.1	0.1	when,
0.4	0.7	at
1	0.8	last,
0.7	0.6	by
0.7	0	reason
0.2	0	of
0.8	0.4	our
0.7	0.4	confabulations,
0.9	0.9	what
0.2	0.9	little
0.4	0.4	nappishness
0.5	0.5	remained
0.6	0.1	in
0.5	0.4	us
0.8	0.3	altogether
0.3	0.9	departed,
0.5	0	and
0.1	0.9	we
0.9	0.7	felt
0.8	0.7	like
0.4	0.9	getting
0.7	0.8	up
0	0.8	again,
0.6	0.9	though
1	0.2	day-break
0.1	0.9	was
0.5	0.1	yet
0.1	0.6	some
0.9	0.4	way
0.5	0.7	down
0.3	0.8	the
0.8	0.5	future.
0.9	0.7	
0.1	0.3	Yes,
0.3	0.9	we
0.4	0.3	became
0.7	0	very
0.3	0.3	wakeful;
1	1	so
0.1	0.5	much
0.6	0.3	so
0.6	0.1	that
0.7	0.4	our
0.9	0.1	recumbent
0.7	0.5	position
0.8	0	began
0.3	0.6	to
0.5	0.3	grow
0.5	0.6	wearisome,
0.1	0.9	and
0.6	0.3	by
0.7	0.1	little
0.3	1	and
0.9	0.3	little
0.2	0.3	we
0.3	0.6	found
0	0.1	ourselves
0.6	0.6	sitting
1	0.7	up;
0	0.4	the
0.8	0.1	clothes
0.9	0.7	well
0.8	0.3	tucked
0.5	0.1	around
0.1	0.3	us,
0.6	0.3	leaning
1	0.9	against
0	0.2	the
0.1	0.9	head-board
0.6	0.6	with
0.8	0.1	our
0.3	0.3	four
0.8	0.5	knees
0.6	0.1	drawn
0.5	0.6	up
0.8	0.6	close
0.1	0.7	together,
0.8	0.5	and
0.6	0.9	our
0.6	0.9	two
0.8	0.3	noses
0	0.1	bending
0.5	1	over
0.9	0.7	them,
0.2	0	as
0.2	0.6	if
0.6	0.5	our
0.5	0.5	kneepans
0.6	0.7	were
0.5	0.4	warming-pans.
0.1	0.5	
0.1	0.7	We
0.5	0.6	felt
0.5	0.7	very
0.3	0.6	nice
0.5	0.9	and
1	0.4	snug,
0.1	0.6	the
0.8	0.9	more
0.1	0.3	so
0.2	0.5	since
0.2	0.4	it
0.2	0.4	was
0.5	0.7	so
0.4	0.8	chilly
0.6	0.3	out
0.8	0.5	of
0.8	0.9	doors;
0.2	0.4	indeed
0.4	0.2	out
0.3	0.9	of
0.8	0.1	bed-clothes
0.3	0.6	too,
0.6	0.4	seeing
1	0.9	that
0.2	0.9	there
0.8	0.7	was
0.5	1	no
0.8	0.1	fire
0.3	0.8	in
0.4	0.3	the
0.4	0.7	room.
0.5	0.3	
0.5	0.7	The
0.3	0.5	more
0.3	0.5	so,
0.1	0.6	I
1	0.4	say,
0.9	0.1	because
0.6	0.6	truly
0.1	0.5	to
0.8	0.3	enjoy
0.6	1	bodily
0.5	0.7	warmth,
0.7	0.4	some
0.9	0.5	small
0.3	0.8	part
0.9	0.3	of
0.1	0.3	you
0.2	0.7	must
0.1	0.5	be
0.4	0.2	cold,
0.1	0.9	for
0.1	0.9	there
0.3	0.1	is
0.9	0.4	no
0.1	0.9	quality
0.3	0.4	in
0.3	0.5	this
0.8	0.8	world
1	0	that
0.7	0.4	is
0.2	0.7	not
0.5	0.8	what
0.6	0.5	it
0.5	0.4	is
0.1	0.5	merely
0.5	0.5	by
0.6	0.9	contrast.
0.3	0.8	
0.7	0.1	Nothing
0.1	0.9	exists
0.3	0.2	in
0.1	0.7	itself.
0.3	0.1	
0.4	0.9	If
0.1	0.1	you
0.2	0.1	flatter
0.8	0.9	yourself
0.9	0.6	that
1	0.9	you
0.2	0.1	are
0.2	0.7	all
0.6	0	over
0.9	0.5	comfortable,
0.3	0.1	and
0.2	0.5	have
0.6	0.3	been
0	0.2	so
0.7	0.4	a
0.8	0.3	long
0.3	0.7	time,
0.3	0.7	then
0.4	0.2	you
0.3	0.6	cannot
1	0.3	be
0.1	0.4	said
0.3	0.1	to
0.2	0.2	be
0.8	0.4	comfortable
0.5	0.4	any
0.5	0.8	more.
0.3	0.8	
1	0.5	But
0.4	0.9	if,
0.5	0.5	like
0.4	0.4	Queequeg
0.9	0.7	and
0.1	0.8	me
0.1	0.8	in
0.9	0.8	the
0.1	0.3	bed,
0.7	0.7	the
0.9	0.5	tip
1	0.4	of
0.3	0.2	your
0.8	0	nose
0.6	0.2	or
0.6	0.5	the
0.3	0.6	crown
0.5	0.8	of
0.3	0.6	your
0.6	0.6	head
0.3	0.7	be
0.4	0.3	slightly
0.9	0.2	chilled,
0.7	0.6	why
0.7	0.1	then,
0.2	1	indeed,
0.3	0.6	in
0.6	0.3	the
0.7	0.5	general
0.2	0.5	consciousness
1	0.7	you
0.3	0.9	feel
0.8	0.5	most
0.6	0.5	delightfully
0.7	0.4	and
0.5	0.9	unmistakably
0.5	0.6	warm.
0.1	0.7	
0.6	0.2	For
0.1	0.1	this
0.4	0.5	reason
0.1	0.6	a
0.3	0.4	sleeping
0.3	0.4	apartment
0.2	0.6	should
0.5	0.6	never
0.9	0.6	be
0.7	0	furnished
0	0.2	with
0.9	0.7	a
0.8	0.6	fire,
0.4	0.9	which
0.2	0.3	is
0.8	0.2	one
0.6	0.3	of
0.1	0.6	the
0.9	0.7	luxurious
0.9	0.6	discomforts
0.8	0.7	of

0.5	0.1	
0.7	1	For
0.2	1	the
0.5	0.1	height
0.6	0.7	of
0.1	0.2	this
0.9	0.6	sort
0.6	0.6	of
1	0.5	deliciousness
0.6	0.2	is
0.5	0.1	to
0.7	0.2	have
0.5	1	nothing
0.3	1	but
0.7	0.9	the
0.3	0.3	blanket
0.4	0.5	between
0.4	0.9	you
0.8	0.2	and
0.2	0.2	your

0.4	0.1	and
0.2	0.7	the

0.9	1	of
0	0.2	the

0.2	0.8	air.
0.7	0.8	
0.1	0.5	Then
0.6	0	there
0.8	0.6	you
0.8	0.8	lie
0.6	0.4	like
0.6	0.6	the
0.5	0.3	one
0.3	0.1	warm
0.1	0.1	spark

0.9	0.4	
0.5	0.4	We
0.7	0.1	had

0.1	0.1	crouching
0.8	0.8	manner
0.2	0.6	for

0.8	0.2	when
0.7	0.8	all
0.1	0.2	at
0.9	0.5	once
0.7	0.4	I

0.7	0.7	I

0.8	0.4	in

0.1	0.8	the

0.2	0.4	
0.7	0.4	Because
0.3	0.3	no

1	0.4	the

0.4	0.6	
0.4	0.9	Upon

0.5	0.1	then,

0.6	0.7	twelve-o'clock-at-night,
0.6	0.4	I

0.2	0.1

0.4	0.6	awake;
0.9	0.9	and
0.7	0.9	besides
0.2	0.5	he

0.9	0.5	could
0.7	0.9	be
0.1	1	both
0.3	0.3	miserable
0.7	0.7	and
0.9	0.9	wicked;
0.5	0.3	infinitely
0.9	0.2	more
0.6	0.1	so,
0.9	0.8	than
0.4	0.9	all
0.2	0.3	his

0.6	0.1	there;
0.3	0.7	and
0.4	0.6	then
0.9	0.1	going
0.3	0.1	on
0.1	0.8	to
0.6	0.3	Nantucket,
0.6	0.8	and
0.4	0.3	seeing
0.7	1	how
0.1	0.6	they
0.4	0.8	spent
0.4	1	their

0.9	0.8	in

0.4	0.4	
0.7	0.4	Thought
0.5	0.8	he,
0.4	0.9	it's
0.6	0.8	a
0	0.3	wicked
0.4	0.8	world
0.9	0.7	in

0.9	0.8	
0.1	0.2	And
0.5	0.7	thus
0.3	0.4	an
0.3	0.8	old
0.1	0.3	idolator
0.8	0.4	at
0.9	0.9	heart,
0.8	0.1	he
0.9	0.2	yet
0.4	0	lived
0.3	0.2	among

0.8	0.9	wore

0.5	0.1	their

0.6	0.1	Hence
0.6	0.4	the

0.1	0.6	
0.5	0.9	By
0.3	1	hints,
0.8	0.7	I
0.4	0.5	asked
0.3	0.3	him
1	0.1	whether
0.6	0.7	he

0.2	0.3	and
0.1	0.5	having
0.4	0.9	a
0.8	0.5	coronation;
0.9	0.2	since
0.8	0.3	he
0.6	0.1	might
0.9	0.4	now
0.4	0.1	consider
0.2	0.2	his
0.4	0.8	father
0.2	0.8	dead
0.4	0.3	and
0.5	0.2	gone,
1	0.4	he
0.7	0.9	being
0.2	0.2	very
0.6	0.9	old
0.8	0.8	and
0.8	0.5	feeble
0.1	0.5	at
0.2	0.2	the
0.3	0.5	last
0.4	0.5	accounts.
0.3	0.8	
0.3	0.9	He
0.1	0.7	answered
0.3	0.7	no,
0.3	0.2	not
0.6	0.5	yet;
0.5	0	and
0.6	0.6	added
0	0	that
0.1	0.8	he
0.8	0.9	was
0.1	0.2	fearful
0.2	0.5	Christianity,
0.5	0.5	or
0.4	0.1	rather
0.2	0.2	Christians,
0.4	0.3	had
0.8	1	unfitted
0.8	0.3	him
0.8	0.7	for

0.4	0.8	the
0.4	0.3	pure
0.1	0	and
1	0.3	undefiled

0.5	0.8	Kings
0.3	0.1	before

1	0.1	
0.8	0.4	But
0.4	0.4	by
0.9	0.7	and
0.1	0	by,
0.4	0.9	he
0.8	0.5	said,
0.8	0.5	he
0.6	0.6	would
0.6	0.5	return,--as
0.2	0.8	soon
0.4	0.8	as
0.3	0.1	he
0.8	0.2	felt
0.2	0.8	himself
0.2	0.2	baptized
0.8	0.3	again.
0.3	0	
0.2	0.6	For
1	0.8	the
1	0.5	nonce,
0.7	0.3	however,
0.3	0.2	he
0.9	0.6	proposed
0.8	0.3	to
0.7	0.1	sail
0.2	1	about,
0.2	0.8	and
0.6	0.2	sow

0.9	0.9	
0.5	0.5	They

0.6	0.8	made
0.1	0.4	a
0.6	0.5	harpooneer
0.4	0.4	of
1	0.4	him,
0.9	0.4	and
0.7	0.5	that

0.4	0.7	now.
0.3	0	
1	0.1	I
0.9	0.1	asked
0.6	0.9	him
0.7	0.2	what
0.8	0.1	might
0.7	0.7	be
0.1	0	his
0.3	0.6	immediate
0.6	0.7	purpose,
0.7	0.9	touching
0.9	0.1	his
0.5	0.1	future
0.1	0.6	movements.
1	0.5	
1	0	He
0	0.1	answered,
0.6	0.3	to
0.8	0.3	go
0.3	0.3	to

0.9	1	again,
0.8	0.3	in

0.8	0.5	vocation.
0.5	0.7	Upon
0.3	0.4	this,
0.2	0.5	I
0.7	0.5	told
0.5	0.7	him
0.1	0.3	that
0.9	0	whaling
1	0.7	was
1	0.7	my
0.6	0.1	own
0.1	0.5	design,
0.8	0.5	and
0.5	0.8	informed
1	0.3	him
0.9	0.1	of

0.7	0.1	promising
0.8	0.8	port
0.5	0.8	for

0.8	0.9	from.
0.7	0.1	
0.6	0.2	He
0.1	0.2	at

0.4	0.1	resolved
0.7	0.3	to

0.1	1	
0.2	0.4	To

0.8	0.7	
0.4	0	I

0.4	0.7	as
0.4	0.8	a

1	0.7	Sideways
0.5	0.3	leaning,
0.4	0.3	we
0.9	0.4	sideways
0.2	0	darted;
0.7	0.9	every
0.1	0.6	ropeyarn
0.6	0.1	tingling

0.8	0.8	
0.1	0.7	So
1	0.8	full
0.2	0.9	of
0.7	0.8	this

0	0.8	scene
0.6	0.6	were

0.4	0.7	stood
0.1	0.7	by
0.2	0.2	the

0.4	0.9	that
0.3	0.8	for
0.8	0.5	some
0.7	0.4	time
1	0	we
0.1	0.9	did
0.2	0.1	not

0.3	1	glances
1	0.9	of
0.2	0.1	the
0.4	0.3	passengers,
0.1	0.2	a
0.6	0.1	lubber-like
0.9	0.2	assembly,
0.9	0.5	who
0	0.6	marvelled
0.1	0.9	that
0.9	0.1	two

0.1	0.3	should
0.3	0.4	be
0.6	0.9	so

0.5	0.6	as
0.6	0.2	though
0.9	0.4	a
0.7	0.7	white
0.5	0.8	man
0.9	0.5	were

0.8	0.9	
0.8	0.5	But
0.3	0.5	there

0.5	0.4	and
0.8	0.5	bumpkins
0.9	0	there,
0.5	0.5	who,
0.2	0.6	by
0.7	0.3	their

0.4	0.9	Queequeg
0.6	0.9	caught
1	0.6	one
0.3	1	of
0.9	0.5	these
0.6	0.2	young

0.4	0.8	mimicking

0.6	0.3	
1	0.4	I

0.8	0.4	
0	0.8	Dropping

0.3	0.6	harpoon,
0.1	0.4	the
0.8	0.6	brawny
0.6	0.8	savage
0.2	0.7	caught
0.3	0.3	him
0.9	0.5	in

1	0.7	
0.4	0.9	Thus

0.8	0.9	
0.1	0.7	In

0.3	0.4	an

0.7	0.8	
0.9	0.6	With

0.2	0.2	after

0.8	0.1	they

0.1	0.6	and
0.1	0.1	there
0.9	0.1	they

0.7	0.8	
0.8	0.4	What

0.3	0.5	TIT-BIT
0.3	0.1	is

0.8	0.1	PEQUOD,
0.5	0.1	you

0.4	0.6	no

0.8	0.1	
0.9	0.3	It

0.4	0.6	I
0.1	0.9	at

0.2	0.7	by

0.3	0.2	seemed

0.9	0.8	who,
0.5	0.4	it
1	0.6	being

0.6	0.4	and
0.7	0	the

0.6	0.8	of
0.3	0.3	command.
0	0.4	
0.1	0.5	He
0.9	0.4	was
0.6	0.6	seated
0.3	0.5	on
0.6	0.1	an

0	0.1	all
0.9	0.8	over

0.9	0.3	carving;
0.4	1	and
0.9	0.3	the
0.9	0.6	bottom
0.8	0.9	of
0.8	0.5	which
0.9	0.4	was
0.3	0.6	formed

0	0.8	
0.3	0.9	There
0.1	0.8	was
0.8	0.6	nothing
0.7	0.6	so
0.4	0.1	very
1	0.4	particular,
0.5	0.6	perhaps,
0.4	0.3	about
0.1	0.6	the

0.5	0.5	of
0.9	0.6	the
0.7	0.8	elderly
1	0.2	man
0.8	0.6	I

0.8	0.3	almost
0.4	0.7	microscopic
0	1	net-work
0.6	0.7	of

0.2	0.6	For

0.9	0.9	not

0.3	0.3	into
0.1	0.5	one
0.5	0.4	scowl,
0.7	0.9	Captain
0.3	0.2	Peleg
0.7	0.7	started

0.6	0.9	Going

0.6	0.3	
0.6	0.9	The

0.8	0.7	was
0.2	0.7	unlimited,
0.1	0	but
0.6	0.5	exceedingly
0.5	0.6	monotonous
0.2	1	and

0.2	0.1	
0.2	0.4	"Not

0.5	0.5	go
0.3	0.3	a-whaling
0.6	0.9	I
0.5	0.9	must,
0.3	1	and

0.1	0.9	would;
0.8	0.5	and
0.2	0.8	the
0.8	0.7	Pequod

0.1	0.9	I
0	0.8	now
0.9	0.4	repeated

0.7	0.1	Seeing

0.3	1	so
0.4	0.9	determined,
0.2	1	he

0.3	0.3	
0.9	0.7	Now,
0.9	0.2	Bildad,
0.8	1	I
0.7	0.5	am
0.8	0.2	sorry
0.8	0.7	to
0.8	0.8	say,
0.3	0.3	had
0.2	0.1	the
0.6	0.4	reputation
0.9	0.6	of
0.1	0.3	being
0.1	0.7	an
0.3	0.7	incorrigible
0	1	old
0.7	0	hunks,
0.9	0.3	and
0.6	0.5	in

0.4	0.2	a
0.4	0.3	bitter,
0.8	0.3	hard
0.1	0.1	task-master.
0.4	0.5	
0.9	0.3	They
0.2	0.4	told
0.7	0.8	me
0.1	0.8	in
0.9	0	Nantucket,
0.8	0.5	though
0.8	1	it
0.9	0.1	certainly
0.9	0.6	seems
0.8	0.8	a
0.8	0.1	curious
0.5	0.9	story,
0.3	0.7	that
0.1	0.1	when
0.5	0.1	he
0.2	0.9	sailed
0.7	0.6	the
0.5	0.6	old
0	0.6	Categut

0.1	0.3	his
0	0.3	crew,
0.1	0.3	upon
0.9	0.5	arriving

0.3	0.1	were
0.8	0.1	mostly
0.4	0.8	all
0.6	0.6	carried
0.3	0.5	ashore
0.2	0.3	to

0.8	0.1	sore
0.3	0.8	exhausted
1	0	and
0.1	0.3	worn

0.2	0.4	
0.6	0.5	For
0.7	0.8	a
0.5	0.9	pious
0.3	1	man,
1	0.1	especially
0.5	0.3	for
0.7	0.3	a
0.4	0.1	Quaker,
0.7	0.1	he
0.3	0.7	was
0.8	0.4	certainly
0.8	0.3	rather
0.3	0.6	hard-hearted,
0.6	0.9	to
0.5	1	say
0.1	0.1	the
0.3	1	least.
0.4	0.6	
0.3	0.1	He
0.9	0.6	never
0.4	0.3	used
0.2	0.5	to
0.6	0.6	swear,
0	0.7	though,
0.5	0.8	at
0.7	0.5	his
0.1	0.2	men,
0.4	0.8	they
0.1	0.2	said;
0.5	0.1	but
0.1	0.8	somehow
0.5	0.4	he
0.6	0.8	got
0.4	0.2	an
0.2	0.3	inordinate
0.2	0.1	quantity
0.8	0.5	of
0.8	0.5	cruel,
0.9	0.4	unmitigated
1	0.8	hard
0.3	0.2	work
0.6	0.4	out
0.4	0.1	of
0.7	0.6	them.
0.3	0.2	
0.8	1	When
0.3	0.6	Bildad
0.8	0.1	was
0.4	0.1	a
0.1	0.3	chief-mate,
0.1	0.4	to

0	0.4	his
0.8	0.3	drab-coloured
0.3	0.6	eye
0.9	1	intently
0.4	0.4	looking
0.7	0.7	at
0.1	0.5	you,
0.8	0.4	made
0.8	0.9	you
0.5	0.1	feel
0.6	0.5	completely
0.9	0.5	nervous,
0.3	0.6	till
0.5	0.1	you
0.8	0.1	could
0.2	0	clutch
0.3	0.5	something--a
0.2	0.8	hammer
0.2	0.1	or
0.7	0.7	a
0.8	0.4	marling-spike,
0.1	0.1	and
0.9	0.9	go
0.6	0.3	to
0.8	0.5	work
0.1	0.4	like
0.3	0.9	mad,
0.2	0.5	at
0.8	0.4	something
0.8	0.9	or
0.8	0.3	other,
0.5	0.6	never
0.7	0.5	mind
0.8	0.7	what.
0.8	0.2	
0.7	0.5	Indolence
0.5	0.4	and
0.9	0.3	idleness
0.4	0.3	perished
0.4	0	before
0.9	0.3	him.
0	0.6	
0.8	0.8	His
1	0.1	own
0.4	0.1	person
0.4	0.8	was
0.9	0.7	the
0.5	0.6	exact
0.9	0.6	embodiment
0.6	0.9	of
0.6	1	his
0.5	0.9	utilitarian
0.7	0.3	character.
0.6	0.9	
1	0.2	On
0	0.1	his
0.8	0.1	long,
0.4	0.6	gaunt
0.8	0.9	body,
0.6	0.1	he
0.3	0.3	carried
0.8	0.9	no
0.6	0.4	spare
0.3	0.4	flesh,
0.6	0.8	no
0.2	0.7	superfluous
0.7	0.2	beard,
0.1	0.3	his
0.8	0.9	chin
0	0.3	having

0.5	0.5	economical
0.3	0.7	nap
0.5	0.3	to
0	0.5	it,
0.8	0.1	like

0.2	1	of
0	0.4	his
0.5	0.3	broad-brimmed

0	0.5	
0.1	0.4	Such,
0.2	0.8	then,
0.7	0.7	was
0.9	1	the
0.1	0.5	person
0.9	0.1	that
0.2	0.1	I
0.5	0	saw
0.9	0.6	seated
0.3	0.7	on
0.4	0.7	the
0.3	0.9	transom
0.9	0.1	when
0.3	0.3	I
0.6	0.5	followed

0.5	0.1	down
0	0.2	into
0.1	0.1	the

0.1	0.8	
0.1	0.3	The

0.3	0.6	between

0.3	0.8	and
0.6	0	there,
0.4	0.6	bolt-upright,
0.4	0.9	sat
0.1	0.4	old
0.7	0.1	Bildad,
1	0.3	who
0.4	0.9	always
0.8	0.6	sat
0.2	0.5	so,
0.7	1	and
0.8	0.8	never
0.7	0.8	leaned,
0.2	0.9	and
0.2	0.4	this
0.6	0.2	to

0.1	0.9	his

0.5	0.9	
0.5	0.9	His
0.6	0.5	broad-brim
0.5	0	was

0.4	0.7	beside

0.9	0.3	his

0.4	0.9	his

0.6	0.7	How
0.3	0.4	far
0.5	0.6	ye

0.4	0.5	Bildad?"
0.2	0.2	
0.7	0.8	As
0.1	0.6	if
0.9	0.5	long
0.3	0.5	habituated
0.1	0.1	to
0.8	0.1	such
0.8	0.3	profane
0.6	0.3	talk
0.5	0.5	from
0.8	0.2	his
0.8	0.3	old
0.4	0.6	shipmate,
0.4	0.9	Bildad,
0.7	0.7	without
0.7	0.3	noticing
0.8	0.6	his
0.4	0.4	present
0.4	0.5	irreverence,
0.7	0.7	quietly
0.9	0.5	looked
0.3	0.8	up,
0.2	0.8	and
0.6	0.2	seeing
0.1	0.7	me,
0.5	0	glanced
0.7	0.5	again
0.8	0.4	inquiringly
0.7	0.8	towards
0.7	0.3	Peleg.
0.4	0.3	
0.9	1	"He
0.6	0.8	says
0.7	0.5	he's
0.4	0.5	our

0.8	0.7	
0.7	0.2	"Dost

0.6	0.6	said
0.2	0.3	Bildad,
0.3	0.4	in
0.2	0.4	a
0.2	0.1	hollow
0.9	0.7	tone,
0.8	0.8	and
0.6	0.5	turning
0.2	0.1	round
0.8	0.5	to
0.4	0.2	me.
0.8	0.9	
0.5	0.1	"I
0.7	0.3	dost,"
0.2	0.7	said
0.1	0.5	I
0	0.4	unconsciously,
0.2	0.8	he
0.3	0.4	was
0.1	0.1	so
1	0.8	intense
1	0.8	a
0.3	0.6	Quaker.
0.2	0.3	
0.5	0.3	"What

1	0.6	of

0.7	0.3	said
0	0.5	Peleg.
0.1	0.7	
0.6	0.2	"He'll

0.1	0.7	said
1	0.2	Bildad,
0.3	0.5	eyeing
0.8	0.6	me,
0.6	1	and
0.9	0.5	then
0.3	0.8	went
0	0.4	on

1	0.7	away
0.2	0.7	at

0.4	0.9	tone
1	0.4	quite
0.7	0	audible.
0.8	0.5	
0.6	0.5	I
0.3	0.5	thought
0.3	0.4	him
0	0.6	the
0.8	0.9	queerest
0.6	0.5	old
0.6	0.3	Quaker
0	0.8	I
0.2	0.5	ever
0.3	0.3	saw,
0.9	1	especially
0.2	0.3	as
0.2	0.5	Peleg,
0.8	1	his
0.4	0.5	friend
0.5	0.6	and
0.5	0.3	old
0.1	0.7	shipmate,
0.3	0.1	seemed
0.1	0.3	such
0.8	0.3	a
0.7	0.8	blusterer.
0.5	0.1	
0.7	0.6	But
0.3	0.5	I
0.9	0.3	said
0.7	0.8	nothing,
0.7	0.8	only
0	0.3	looking
0.8	0.7	round
0.9	0.1	me
0.3	0.7	sharply.
0.1	0.7	
0.1	0.6	Peleg
1	0.2	now
0.1	0.4	threw
0.9	0.2	open
0.6	0.8	a
0.5	0.6	chest,
0.2	0.3	and
0.8	0.8	drawing
0.8	0.5	forth
0.1	0.2	the
0.9	0.9	ship's
0	0.4	articles,
0.9	0.6	placed
1	0.9	pen
0.1	0.9	and
0.3	0.6	ink
0.8	0.4	before
0.3	0.3	him,
0.5	0.8	and
0.6	0.2	seated
0.8	0.7	himself
0.5	0.2	at
0.2	0.6	a
0.9	1	little
0.8	0.6	table.
1	0.5	
0.2	0.3	I
0.6	0.9	began
0.7	0.5	to
0.1	0.4	think
0.5	0.4	it
0.2	0.1	was
0.4	0.3	high
0.7	0.5	time
0.6	0.2	to
0.5	0.2	settle
0.5	0.8	with
0.8	0.6	myself
1	0.9	at
0.7	0.5	what
0.8	0	terms
0.8	0.8	I
0.9	0	would
0.1	0.7	be
0.7	0.8	willing
0.3	0.8	to
0.5	0.7	engage
0.6	0.3	for
0.1	0.3	the
0.9	0.7	voyage.
0.8	0.5	
0.7	0.6	I
0.8	0.5	was
0.1	0.5	already
0.9	0.1	aware
0.6	0.9	that
0.1	0.2	in
0.4	0.4	the
0.5	0.5	whaling
0.2	0.2	business
0.1	0.9	they
0.9	0.1	paid
0.6	0.1	no
0.8	0.3	wages;
0.3	0.1	but
0.1	0.3	all
0.1	0.5	hands,
0.8	0.6	including
0.1	0.4	the
1	0.1	captain,
0.5	0.3	received
0	0.3	certain
0	0.1	shares
0.5	0.7	of
0.2	0.5	the
0.9	0.4	profits
0.2	1	called
0.5	0.7	lays,
0.7	0.3	and
0.6	0.8	that
0.8	0.1	these
0.2	0.4	lays
0	0.4	were
0.6	0.4	proportioned
0.8	0.9	to
0.3	0.3	the
0.2	0.8	degree
0.5	0.4	of
0.6	0.3	importance
0.9	0.3	pertaining
0.8	0.1	to
0.9	0.9	the
0.4	0.7	respective
0.3	0.7	duties
0.3	0.9	of
0.6	0.1	the
0.3	0.3	ship's
0.8	0.4	company.
0.4	0	
0.5	0.1	I
0.2	0.8	was
0.9	0.2	also
1	0.8	aware
0.2	0.8	that
0.5	1	being
0.5	0.8	a
0.8	0.5	green
0.9	0.9	hand
0.6	0.7	at
0.1	0.2	whaling,
0.5	0.1	my
0.7	0.6	own
0.4	0.8	lay
0.2	0.8	would
0.9	0.9	not
0.1	0.5	be
0.5	0.8	very
0.9	0.5	large;
0.7	0.1	but
0.8	1	considering
0.9	0	that
0.8	0.8	I
0.5	0.9	was
0.7	0.2	used
0.5	0.1	to
0.6	0.9	the
0.2	0.2	sea,
0.2	0.2	could
0.7	0.1	steer
0.4	0.2	a
0.9	0.7	ship,
0.7	0.4	splice
0.9	0.7	a
0.3	0.4	rope,
0.2	0.1	and
0.2	0.4	all
0.1	0.4	that,
0.4	0.6	I
0.3	0.8	made
0.5	0.9	no
0.8	0.3	doubt
0.4	0.3	that
0.4	0.1	from
0.2	0.1	all
0.9	0.7	I
0.6	0.2	had
0.7	1	heard
0.4	0.9	I
0.2	0.1	should
0.1	0.5	be
0.3	0.9	offered
1	1	at
0.7	0.2	least
0.7	0.6	the
0.7	0.5	275th
0.4	0.9	lay--that
0.9	0.1	is,
0.1	0.1	the
0	0.8	275th
0.7	0.2	part
0.1	0.6	of
0.4	0.8	the
0.2	0.4	clear
0.6	0.6	net
0	0.2	proceeds
0.9	0.9	of
0.9	0.2	the
0.5	0.2	voyage,
0.9	0.1	whatever
0.1	0.8	that
0.1	0.9	might
0.4	0.1	eventually
0.5	0.4	amount
0.1	0.5	to.
0.1	0.7	
0.7	0.7	And
0.1	0.2	though
0.5	0.2	the
0.1	0.9	275th
0.8	0.5	lay
0.1	0	was
0.4	0.7	what
0.7	0.6	they
0.6	0.3	call
0.9	0.2	a
1	0.6	rather
1	0.8	LONG
0.7	0.7	LAY,
0.1	0.1	yet
0.6	0.6	it
0.5	0.3	was
0.8	0.3	better
0.3	0.7	than
0.4	0.4	nothing;
0.5	0.4	and
0.2	0.3	if
0.8	0.7	we
0.6	0.2	had
0.9	0.8	a
0.7	0	lucky
0.5	0.8	voyage,
0.2	0.3	might
0	1	pretty
0.5	0	nearly
0.1	0.8	pay
0.3	0.3	for
0.4	0.1	the
1	0.5	clothing
0.1	0.9	I
0.5	0.7	would
0.9	0.9	wear
0.1	0.8	out
0.3	0.5	on
0.2	0.1	it,
0.1	0	not
0.4	0.3	to
0.7	1	speak
0.2	1	of
0.2	0.2	my
0.1	0.6	three
0.7	0.4	years'
0.8	0.2	beef
0.3	0.6	and
0.8	0.9	board,
0.9	0.1	for
0.2	0	which
0.3	0.4	I
0.8	0.9	would
1	0.6	not
0.3	0.6	have
0.3	0.6	to
0.8	0.1	pay
1	0.7	one
1	0.6	stiver.
0.2	0.8	
0.8	0.3	It
0.1	0.7	might
0.3	0.9	be
0.1	0.6	thought
0.2	0.7	that
0.6	0.5	this
0.1	0.9	was
0.9	0.7	a
0.2	0.6	poor
0.1	1	way
0.8	0.4	to
0.7	0	accumulate
0.2	0.9	a
0.3	0.3	princely
0.6	1	fortune--and
0.8	0.9	so
0.3	0.1	it
0.3	0.1	was,
0.3	0.3	a
0.2	0.7	very
0.1	0.1	poor
0.1	0.3	way
0.3	0	indeed.
0.1	0.4	
0.9	0.9	But
0.6	0.3	I
1	0.5	am
0.8	0.6	one
0.7	0.1	of
1	0.6	those
0.1	0.2	that
0.4	0.3	never
0.3	1	take
0.7	0.8	on
0.9	0.2	about
0.6	0.1	princely
0.6	0.8	fortunes,
0.1	0.1	and
0.2	0.4	am
1	0.5	quite
0.9	0.4	content
0.4	0.8	if
0.9	0.5	the
0.4	0.3	world
0.7	0.6	is
0.5	0.3	ready
0.7	0.6	to
0.4	0.3	board
0.3	0.8	and
0.2	0.4	lodge
0.5	0.2	me,
0.8	0.9	while
0.6	0.5	I
0.7	0.1	am
0.2	0.7	putting
0.2	0.1	up
0.7	0.6	at
0.9	0.7	this
0.1	0.8	grim
0.9	0	sign
0.8	0.3	of
0.1	0.8	the
0.5	0.9	Thunder
0.3	0.6	Cloud.
0.8	0.1	
0.4	0	Upon
0.7	0.8	the
0.2	0.4	whole,
0.8	0.4	I
0.8	0.1	thought
0.4	0	that
0.9	0.8	the
0.5	0.2	275th
0.7	0.7	lay
0.1	0.5	would
0.3	0.7	be
0.3	0.4	about
0.2	0.3	the
0.7	0.3	fair
0.4	0.4	thing,
0.9	0.1	but
0.3	0.3	would
0.8	0.8	not
0.2	0.5	have
0.3	0.3	been
0.7	0.9	surprised
0.4	0.8	had
0.9	0.6	I
0.8	0.2	been
0.8	0.2	offered
1	0.4	the
0.3	0.5	200th,
0.4	0.9	considering
0.2	0.9	I
0.9	0.9	was
0.4	0.2	of
0.4	0.6	a
0.3	0.5	broad-shouldered
0.7	0.2	make.
0.1	0.5	
0.8	0.8	But
0.4	0.1	one
0.8	0.3	thing,
0.4	0.2	nevertheless,
0.4	0.7	that
0.8	0.5	made
0.8	0.2	me
0	0.1	a
0.7	0.7	little
0.8	0.9	distrustful
0.9	0.1	about
0.4	0.9	receiving
0.8	0.5	a
0.4	1	generous
0.8	0.2	share
0.3	0.2	of
0.7	0.3	the
0.5	1	profits
0	0.5	was
0.3	0.4	this:
0.6	0.9	Ashore,
0.8	0.5	I
0.1	0.1	had
0.9	0.2	heard
0.1	0.8	something
0.5	0.6	of
0.2	0.5	both
0.5	0	Captain
0.2	0.2	Peleg
0.3	0.1	and
0.2	0.4	his
0.1	0.8	unaccountable
0.7	0.4	old
0.9	0.5	crony
0.1	0.4	Bildad;
0.3	0.9	how
0.3	0.3	that
0.5	0.5	they
0.3	0.2	being
0.1	0.2	the
0.6	0.2	principal
0.2	0.9	proprietors
0.3	0.3	of
0.7	0	the
0.6	0.8	Pequod,
0	0.9	therefore
0.4	0.2	the
0.7	0.8	other
0.1	0.9	and
0.7	0.3	more
0.8	0.3	inconsiderable
0.5	0.8	and
0.8	0.4	scattered
0.5	0.8	owners,
0.9	0.8	left
0.9	0.9	nearly
0.6	0.2	the
0.9	0.8	whole
0.9	0.8	management
1	0.1	of

0.4	0.9	to
0.8	0.7	these
0.4	0.9	two.
0.4	0.6	And
0.9	0.2	I
0.1	0.7	did
0.5	0.3	not
0.1	0.8	know
0.3	0.7	but
0.2	0.7	what
0.4	0.3	the
0.1	1	stingy
0.5	0.9	old
1	0.4	Bildad
0.7	0.8	might
0.1	0.5	have
0.3	0.4	a
0.9	0.1	mighty
0.8	0.6	deal
0.9	0.2	to
1	1	say
0.4	0.9	about
0.2	0.2	shipping
0.4	0.3	hands,
1	0.1	especially
0.6	0.8	as
0.8	0.8	I
0.7	0	now
0.6	0.1	found
0.9	0.8	him
0.9	0.4	on
1	1	board
0.7	0.9	the

1	0.6	quite
0.9	0.3	at

0.9	0.6	there
0.2	0.3	in

0.4	0.1	
0.9	0.9	Now
0.9	0.9	while
0	0.5	Peleg
0.7	0.8	was
0.1	0.5	vainly
0.8	0.9	trying
0.9	0.9	to

0.3	0.4	considering
0.1	0.7	that

0.8	0.1	
0.7	0.1	And,
0.1	0.4	after

0	0.6	
0.5	0.3	Turning
0.3	0.2	back
0.6	1	I
0.1	0.9	accosted

0.1	0.2	It's

0.8	0.1	
0.7	0.8	"Yes,

0.5	0.4	good
1	0.8	man--something
0.1	0.5	like
0.8	0.7	me--only
0.7	0.7	there's
0.9	0.1	a
0.9	0.4	good
0.2	0.1	deal
0.9	0.8	more
0.5	0.1	of
1	0.7	him.
0	0.7	
0.5	0.3	Aye,
0.4	0.9	aye,
0.9	0.8	I
0.2	0.8	know
0.4	0.3	that
0.8	0.5	he
0.6	0.3	was
0.3	0.9	never
0.5	0.7	very
0.1	0.4	jolly;
0.6	0.8	and
0.2	0.2	I
0	0.9	know
1	0.2	that
0.2	1	on
0.5	0.8	the
0.8	0.4	passage
0.8	0.5	home,
0.1	0.4	he
0.6	0.8	was
0.3	0.6	a
0.7	0.7	little
0.3	0.4	out
0.1	0.3	of
0.9	0	his
0.4	0.3	mind
1	0.4	for
0.2	0.7	a
0.5	0.7	spell;
0.7	0.2	but
0	0.7	it
0.6	0.5	was
0.1	0.6	the
0.9	0.3	sharp
0.1	0.5	shooting
0.9	0.2	pains
0.1	0.4	in
0.2	0.4	his
0.9	0.6	bleeding
0.6	0.2	stump
0.1	0.4	that
1	0.9	brought
0.2	0.9	that
0.3	0.4	about,
0.8	0.6	as
0.5	0.9	any
1	0.8	one
0.2	0.3	might
0.7	0.1	see.
0.9	0.9	
0.5	0	I
0.8	1	know,
1	0.2	too,
0.6	0.1	that
0.7	0.9	ever
0.3	0.7	since
0.7	0.3	he
0.2	0.3	lost
1	0.2	his
0.7	0.9	leg
0.6	0.2	last
0.1	0.5	voyage
0.6	0.6	by
0.6	0.1	that
0.2	0.6	accursed
0.6	0.5	whale,
0.5	0.2	he's
0.6	0.7	been
0.7	0.6	a
0.7	0.9	kind
0.6	0.9	of
0.5	0.1	moody--desperate
0.5	0.9	moody,
0.7	0.7	and
0.4	0.1	savage
0.1	0.8	sometimes;
0.6	0.5	but
0.4	0.8	that
0.6	0.4	will
0.9	0.4	all
0.9	0.2	pass
0.9	0.2	off.
0.7	0.9	
0.3	0.5	And
0.5	0.5	once
0.1	0.7	for
0.5	0.2	all,
0.4	0	let
0.8	0.3	me
0.7	0.9	tell
0.1	0.1	thee
0.2	0.9	and
0.5	0.3	assure
0.3	1	thee,
0.4	0.5	young
1	0.7	man,
0.9	0.2	it's
1	0.5	better
0.6	0.7	to
0.9	0.3	sail
0.4	0.1	with
0.1	0.2	a
0.5	0.3	moody
0.8	1	good
0.9	0.6	captain
0.8	0.4	than
0.6	0.6	a
0	0.3	laughing
0.2	0.9	bad
0.4	0.1	one.
0.3	0.5	
0.7	0.8	So
0.1	0.4	good-bye
0.5	1	to
1	0.7	thee--and
0.8	0.4	wrong
0.5	0.9	not
0.7	0.2	Captain
0.7	1	Ahab,
0	0.8	because
1	0	he
0.8	0.1	happens
0.1	0.5	to
0.6	0.6	have
0.7	0.5	a
1	0.5	wicked
0.4	0.4	name.
0.6	0.8	
1	0.3	Besides,
0.7	0	my
0.7	0.2	boy,
0.3	0.5	he
0	0.5	has
0.6	0.8	a
0.7	0.8	wife--not
0.1	0.7	three
0.5	0.2	voyages
0.6	0.3	wedded--a
0.4	0.2	sweet,
0.9	0.3	resigned
0.2	0.3	girl.
0.1	0.4	
0.2	0.8	Think
0.8	0.8	of
0.2	0.9	that;
0.8	0.8	by
0.3	0.6	that
0.1	0.3	sweet
0.7	0.1	girl
0.7	0.3	that
0.7	0.7	old
0.9	0.4	man
0.1	0.9	has
0.4	0.2	a
0.8	0.3	child:
0.7	0.8	hold
0.7	0.7	ye
0.2	0.7	then
0.6	0.9	there
0.2	0.1	can
0	0	be
0.3	0.2	any
0.8	0.4	utter,
0.5	0.9	hopeless
0.8	0.8	harm
0.6	0.2	in
1	0.9	Ahab?
0.8	0.4	
0.3	0.5	No,
0.3	0.3	no,
0.5	0.9	my
0.8	0.2	lad;
0.9	0.7	stricken,
0.7	0.7	blasted,
0.7	0.1	if
0.9	0.2	he
0.5	1	be,
0.5	0.4	Ahab
0.1	0.9	has
0.4	0.5	his
0.8	0.3	humanities!"
0.6	0.1	
0.3	0.2	As
0.5	0.4	I
0.9	0	walked
0.6	0.1	away,
0.1	0.2	I
0	0.4	was
0.4	0.1	full
0.8	1	of
1	1	thoughtfulness;
0.1	0.6	what
0.7	0.1	had
0.1	0.5	been
0.8	0.8	incidentally
0.2	0.6	revealed
0	0.4	to
0.5	0.1	me
0.2	1	of
0.8	1	Captain
0.2	0.1	Ahab,
0.1	0	filled
0.2	0.6	me
0.6	0.8	with
0.2	0.9	a
0.9	0.9	certain
0.6	0.4	wild
0.1	0.4	vagueness
0.7	0.2	of
0.5	0.2	painfulness
0.4	0.3	concerning
0.5	0.6	him.
0.8	0.5	
0.4	0.8	And
0.4	0.5	somehow,
0.9	0.5	at
0.9	0.8	the
0.8	0.4	time,
0.8	0.5	I
0.2	0.6	felt
0.4	0.2	a
0.8	0.1	sympathy
0.9	0.9	and
0.8	0.5	a
0.7	0.5	sorrow
0.9	1	for
0.7	0.8	him,
0.1	0.2	but
0.6	0.4	for
0.1	0.9	I
0.3	0.8	don't
0.8	0.8	know
0.8	0	what,
0.1	0.8	unless
0.1	0.2	it
0.6	0.8	was
0.3	0.6	the
0.8	0.5	cruel
0.7	0.8	loss
0.5	0.7	of
0.2	0.9	his
0.7	0.9	leg.
0.4	0.4	
0.1	0.9	And
0.7	0.1	yet
0.8	0.9	I
0.1	0.2	also
0.4	0.2	felt
0.5	0.2	a
0	0.2	strange
0.9	0.6	awe
0.9	0.2	of
0.7	0.4	him;
0.9	0.2	but
1	0.3	that
1	0.4	sort
0.9	0.4	of
0.5	0.8	awe,
0.2	0.8	which
0.5	0	I
0.4	0.9	cannot
0.5	0.7	at
0.8	0.2	all
1	0.7	describe,
0.7	0.9	was
0.2	0.2	not
0.2	0.8	exactly
0.7	0.1	awe;
0.2	0.8	I
0.2	0.8	do
0.1	0.8	not
0.9	0.4	know
0.6	0.1	what
0.1	0.3	it
0.5	0.7	was.
0.8	0.3	
0.3	0.6	But
1	0.4	I
0.5	0.7	felt
0.8	0.1	it;
0	0.5	and
0	0.5	it
0	0.6	did
0	0.2	not
0.3	0.4	disincline
0.5	0.5	me
0.5	0.8	towards
0.6	1	him;
0.2	0.8	though
0.9	0.9	I
0.3	0.7	felt
0.7	0.5	impatience
0.9	0.8	at
0.7	0.7	what
0.6	0.8	seemed
0.6	0.2	like
1	0.3	mystery
0.7	0.7	in
0.7	0.2	him,
0.6	0.1	so
0.6	0.2	imperfectly
0.8	0.8	as
0.9	0.7	he
0.7	0.6	was
0.8	0.7	known
0.6	0.4	to
0.9	0.9	me
0.9	0.4	then.
0.2	0.8	
0.1	0.4	However,
0.7	1	my
0.3	0.7	thoughts
1	0.7	were
0.6	0.7	at
0.2	0.9	length
0.8	0.4	carried
0.6	0.8	in
0.1	0.2	other
0.9	0.5	directions,
0.4	0.5	so
0.2	0.1	that
0.8	0.9	for
0.6	0.6	the
0.8	0.6	present
0.6	0.7	dark
0.5	0.4	Ahab
0.3	0.6	slipped
0.8	0.9	my
0.9	0.1	mind.

0.6	0.1	CHAPTER

0.6	0.9	The

0.3	0.6	
0.3	0.5	
0.6	0.3	As
0.3	0.4	Queequeg's
0.4	0.7	Ramadan,
0.7	0.4	or
0.3	0.5	Fasting
0.6	0.3	and
0.7	0.8	Humiliation,
0.2	0.2	was
0.6	0.7	to
0.1	0.2	continue
0.7	0.4	all
0.6	0.2	day,
0.2	1	I
1	0.9	did
0.2	0.6	not
0.6	0.2	choose
0.9	0.2	to
0.7	0.1	disturb
0.4	0.5	him
0.7	0.9	till
0.9	0.2	towards
0.4	0	night-fall;
0.5	0	for
0.5	0.5	I
0.5	0.2	cherish
0.1	0	the
0.2	0.2	greatest
0.8	0.6	respect
0.7	0.7	towards
0.9	0.5	everybody's
0.6	0.7	religious
0.6	0.9	obligations,
0.7	0.2	never
0.9	0.5	mind
0.8	0.7	how
0.5	0.5	comical,
0.7	0.4	and
0.8	0.8	could
0.4	0.2	not
0.8	0.4	find
0.7	0.2	it
0.5	0.4	in
0.6	0.5	my
0	0.9	heart
0.5	0.8	to
0.5	0.1	undervalue
1	0.8	even
0.9	0.1	a
0.1	0	congregation
0.9	0.9	of
0.7	0.1	ants
0.8	0.6	worshipping

0.2	0.4	certain

0.1	0.4	earth,
0.2	0.6	who
0.9	0.8	with
0.7	0.9	a
0.7	0.4	degree
0.1	0.3	of
0.3	0.7	footmanism
0.4	0.6	quite
0.3	0.2	unprecedented
0.9	0.3	in
0.1	0.5	other

0.1	0.6	bow
0.9	0.8	down
0.1	0.8	before
0.5	0.9	the
0.6	0	torso
0.7	0.8	of
0.6	0.2	a
0.5	0.5	deceased
0.3	0.1	landed
0.3	0.1	proprietor
0.5	0.8	merely
0.3	0.4	on
0.3	0.9	account
0.3	0.7	of
0.8	0.7	the
0.5	0	inordinate
0.1	1	possessions
0.6	0.7	yet

0.1	0.4	and

0	0.1	in
0.5	0.7	his
0.2	0.3	name.
0.9	0.1	
0.7	0.1	I
0.7	0.7	say,
0.6	1	we
0.1	0.2	good
0.2	0	Presbyterian
0.6	0.3	Christians
0.7	0.8	should
0.8	0.1	be
0.2	0.9	charitable
0.7	0.5	in
0.2	0.8	these
0.7	0.6	things,
0.3	0.5	and
0.1	0.9	not
0.3	0.1	fancy
0.2	0.2	ourselves
0.3	0.2	so
0.8	0.5	vastly
1	0.2	superior
0.8	0.7	to
0.3	0.3	other
0.5	0	mortals,
0	0	pagans
0.8	0.4	and
0.9	0.5	what
0.7	0.1	not,
0.3	0.4	because
0.4	0.6	of
0.2	0.1	their
0.5	0.2	half-crazy
0.7	0.7	conceits
0.6	0.2	on
0.6	0.9	these
0.8	0.8	subjects.
0.3	0.1	
0.2	0.2	There
0.8	0.2	was
1	0.9	Queequeg,
0.2	0.6	now,
0.3	0.5	certainly
0.3	0.8	entertaining
0.6	0.3	the
0.7	0.5	most
0.8	0.5	absurd
0.3	0.3	notions
0.4	0.9	about
0.4	0.9	Yojo
0.9	0.2	and
1	0.6	his
0.1	0.7	Ramadan;--but
0.8	0.7	what
0.1	0.3	of
0.1	0.6	that?
0.7	0.7	Queequeg
0.8	0.4	thought
0	0.2	he
0.4	0.7	knew
0	0.1	what
0.6	0.6	he
0.4	0.5	was
0.5	0.9	about,
0.2	0.3	I
0.3	0.7	suppose;
0.1	0.4	he
0.1	0.2	seemed
1	0.7	to
0.6	1	be
0.7	0.7	content;
0.2	0.7	and
0.2	0.5	there
0.9	0.8	let
0.1	0.6	him
0.6	0.7	rest.
0.7	0.9	
0.2	0.1	All
1	0.3	our
0.9	0.7	arguing
0.4	0	with
0.7	0.2	him
0.7	0.9	would
0.5	0.7	not
0.1	0.5	avail;
0.9	1	let
0.7	0.6	him
0.3	0.5	be,
0.6	0.1	I
0.4	0.5	say:
1	0.7	and
0.4	0.5	Heaven
0.3	0.3	have
0.3	0.5	mercy
0.7	0.5	on
0.9	0	us
0.4	0.4	all--Presbyterians
0.2	0	and
1	0.5	Pagans
0.6	0.1	alike--for
1	0.5	we
0.5	0.1	are
0.2	0.7	all
0.9	0.4	somehow
0.6	0.3	dreadfully
0.1	0.9	cracked
0.6	0.4	about
0.2	0.3	the
0.1	0.2	head,
0.4	0.8	and
0.9	0.3	sadly
0.1	0.3	need
0.1	0.5	mending.
0.2	0.8	
0.6	0.3	Towards
0.6	0.4	evening,
0.5	0.9	when
0.9	0.4	I
0.5	0.8	felt
0	0.9	assured
0.5	0.6	that
0.6	0.2	all
0.2	1	his
0.4	0	performances
1	0.4	and
1	0	rituals
0	0.1	must
0.3	0.5	be
0.3	0.9	over,
0.7	0.6	I
0.3	0.3	went
0.5	0.6	up
0.7	0.8	to
0.4	0.2	his
0.6	0.3	room
0.1	0.3	and
0.7	0.5	knocked
0.6	0	at
0.1	0.5	the
0.1	0.4	door;
0.7	0.9	but
0.3	0.7	no
1	0.5	answer.
0.3	0.3	
0.1	0.8	I
0.3	0.7	tried
0.5	0.2	to
0.7	0.6	open
0.1	0.4	it,
0	0.2	but
0.6	0.3	it
0.9	1	was
0.1	0.6	fastened
0.2	0.9	inside.
0.4	0.7	"Queequeg,"
0.2	0.6	said
0.2	0.4	I
0.7	0.6	softly
0.1	0.2	through
0.2	0.6	the
0.3	0.9	key-hole:--all
0.1	0.6	silent.
0.9	0.2	
0.7	0.3	"I
0.7	0.2	say,
0.6	0.1	Queequeg!
0.5	0.1	why
0.9	0.6	don't
0.3	0.8	you
0.1	0.7	speak?
0.1	0.9	
0.1	0.5	It's
0.2	0.3	I--Ishmael."
0.4	0.9	
0.9	0.8	But
1	0.3	all
0.1	0.6	remained
0.2	0.5	still
0.8	0.3	as
0.2	0.4	before.
0.7	0.6	
0	0.7	I
0.7	0.5	began
0.4	1	to
0.2	0.6	grow
0.9	0	alarmed.
0.3	0.7	
0.2	0.7	I
0.4	0.7	had
0.7	0.7	allowed
0.5	0.5	him
0.1	0.7	such
0.8	0.9	abundant
0.5	0.9	time;
0.4	0.1	I
0.7	0.8	thought
0.5	0.8	he
0.7	0.1	might
0.3	0.4	have
0	0.5	had
0.1	0.1	an
0.8	0.1	apoplectic
0	0.6	fit.
0.9	0.7	
1	0.3	I
0	0.9	looked
0.5	0.2	through
0.9	0.5	the
0.3	0.8	key-hole;
0.5	0.7	but
0.3	0.4	the
0.1	1	door
0.9	0.9	opening
0.6	0	into
0.6	0.1	an
0.4	0.5	odd
0.8	0.5	corner
0.1	0	of
0.3	0.8	the
0.5	0.4	room,
1	0.9	the
0.5	0.8	key-hole
0.9	0.3	prospect
0.7	0.8	was
0.5	0.5	but
1	0.3	a
0.4	1	crooked
0.4	0.4	and
0.8	0.1	sinister
0.3	0.3	one.
0.8	0.3	
0.9	0.9	I
0.3	0.4	could
0.2	0.4	only
0.5	0.6	see
0.9	0.8	part
0.5	0.1	of
0.5	0.4	the
0.7	0.9	foot-board
0.3	0.5	of
0.8	0.4	the
0.2	0	bed
0.7	1	and
0.5	0.1	a
0.5	0.6	line
0.2	0	of
0.3	0.7	the
0.5	0.4	wall,
0.9	0.5	but
0.1	0.7	nothing
0.8	0.1	more.
0.8	0.8	
1	0.1	I
0.1	0	was
0.3	0	surprised
0.8	0.8	to
0.4	0.5	behold
0.7	0.3	resting
0.5	0.6	against
0.9	0.3	the
0.1	0.7	wall
0.3	0.7	the
1	0.5	wooden
0.4	0.2	shaft
0.8	0.3	of
0.3	0.3	Queequeg's
0.9	0.9	harpoon,
0.3	0.2	which
0.3	0.3	the
0.8	0.7	landlady
0.1	0.5	the
0	0.8	evening
0.4	0.4	previous
0.3	0.3	had
0.5	0.2	taken
0.3	0.3	from
0.7	0.3	him,
0.2	0.4	before
0.7	0.5	our
0.7	0.5	mounting
0.7	0.4	to
1	0.8	the
1	0.5	chamber.
0.5	0.9	
0.5	0.7	That's
0.9	0.5	strange,
0.7	0.5	thought
0.5	0.5	I;
0.2	1	but
0.6	0.1	at
0.2	0.2	any
0.8	0.6	rate,
0.7	0.1	since
0.9	0.5	the
0.4	0.6	harpoon
0.1	0.4	stands
0.9	0.1	yonder,
0.3	0.2	and
0.6	0.3	he
0.8	0.9	seldom
0.6	0.8	or
0.7	0	never
0.4	1	goes
1	0.8	abroad
0.7	0.7	without
0	0.6	it,
0.2	0.3	therefore
0.5	0.1	he
0.7	1	must
0.3	0.1	be
0.3	0.2	inside
0.7	0.1	here,
0.4	0.1	and
0.5	0.5	no
0.4	0.2	possible
0.1	0.2	mistake.
0.3	0.6	
0.3	0	"Queequeg!--Queequeg!"--all
0.9	0.6	still.
0.1	0.1	
0.7	0.9	Something
0.1	0.9	must
0.9	0.9	have
0.8	0.3	happened.
0.8	0.7	Apoplexy!
0.7	0.3	
0.4	0.8	I
0.4	0.1	tried
0.8	0.9	to
0.4	0.4	burst
0.1	0.9	open
0.2	0.8	the
0.1	0.2	door;
0.6	0.9	but
0.8	0.1	it
1	1	stubbornly
0.7	1	resisted.
0.6	1	
0.7	0.5	Running
0.1	0.8	down
0.7	0.9	stairs,
1	0.5	I
0.7	0.7	quickly
0.6	0.4	stated
0.8	0.3	my
0.3	0	suspicions
0.6	0.2	to
0.4	0.9	the
1	0.4	first
0.4	0.8	person
0.1	0.4	I
0.4	0.6	met--the
0.3	0.7	chamber-maid.
0.7	0.4	
0.4	0.6	"La!
0.6	0.6	la!"
0.8	0.8	she
0	0.9	cried,
0.1	0.4	"I
0	0.9	thought
0.8	0.1	something
0.3	0.2	must
0.7	0.3	be
0.7	0.3	the

1	0.7	
0.5	0.5	I
0.6	0.8	went
0.2	0.5	to
0.6	0.7	make
0.6	0.8	the
0.1	0.8	bed
0.2	0.9	after

0.3	0.9	
0.8	0.3	But

0.3	0.1	had
0.4	0.2	both
0.5	0.1	gone

0.4	0.6	locked
0.9	0.8	your

0.7	0.6	with

0.4	0.2	towards

0.8	0.4	Mrs.

0.8	0.4	to
0.5	0.4	the
0.2	0.9	ceiling;
0.2	1	and
0.8	0.8	there,
0.9	1	good
0.5	0.4	heavens!
0.6	0.3	there
0.4	0.2	sat
0.8	0.3	Queequeg,
0.1	0.4	altogether
0.9	0	cool
0.3	0.2	and
0.8	0.3	self-collected;
0.2	0.8	right
0.4	0.1	in
0.6	1	the
0.3	0.7	middle
0.5	0.7	of
0.1	0.6	the
0.5	0.8	room;
0.6	1	squatting
0.2	0.5	on
0.3	0.7	his
0.7	0.5	hams,
0.5	0.5	and
0.9	0.6	holding
0.6	0.2	Yojo
0.5	0.3	on
0	0.1	top
0.4	0.4	of
0.3	0.8	his
0.1	0.2	head.
0.9	0.2	
0.5	0	He
0.1	0.4	looked
0.5	0.3	neither
0.5	0.8	one
0.6	0.2	way
0.9	0.1	nor
0.1	0.1	the
1	0	other
0.9	0.1	way,
0.8	0.4	but
0.8	0.2	sat
0	0.9	like
0.3	0.9	a
0.9	0.9	carved
0.9	0.6	image
0.8	0.9	with
0.5	0.3	scarce
1	0.4	a
0.1	0.7	sign
0.6	0.8	of
0.6	0.1	active
0.1	1	life.
0.4	0.6	
0.4	0.2	"Queequeg,"
0.9	0.6	said
0.4	0.2	I,
0.3	0.7	going
0.9	0.8	up
0.1	0.8	to
0.8	0.8	him,
0.4	0.6	"Queequeg,
0.1	0.2	what's
0.5	0.7	the
0.4	0.5	matter
0.2	0.2	with
0.1	0.5	you?"
0.3	0.2	
0	0.9	"He

0.3	0.8	said
0.9	0.8	the
0.1	0.1	landlady.
0.3	0.6	
0.5	0	But
0.1	0.7	all
0.7	0.9	we
0.2	1	said,
0.7	0.5	not
0.9	0.6	a

0.9	0.6	we
0.9	0.5	drag
1	0	out
0.1	0.8	of
0.5	0.2	him;
0.2	0.7	I
0.3	0.2	almost
0.7	0.4	felt
0.7	0.2	like
0.8	0	pushing
0.7	1	him
0.1	0.5	over,
0	0.9	so
0.3	0.6	as
0.5	0.8	to
0.8	0.1	change
0.2	0.5	his
0.5	0.2	position,
0.5	0.4	for
0	0.3	it
1	0.8	was
0.4	0.4	almost
0.5	0.6	intolerable,
0.3	0.8	it
0.9	0.5	seemed
0.2	0.4	so
0	0.1	painfully
0	0.7	and
0.3	0.3	unnaturally
0.9	0.7	constrained;
0.4	0.2	especially,
0.5	0.2	as
1	0.8	in
0.8	0.1	all
0.4	0.4	probability
0.7	0.2	he
0.4	0.5	had
0.8	0.6	been
0.8	0.9	sitting
0.7	0.5	so
0.8	0.5	for
0.5	0.4	upwards
0.9	0.1	of
0.2	1	eight
0	0.2	or
0.7	0.3	ten
0.5	0.3	hours,
0.6	0.3	going
0.5	0.8	too
0.1	0.2	without

0.7	0.6	meals.
0.9	0.4	
0.9	0.1	"Mrs.
0.3	0.7	Hussey,"
0.1	0.8	said
0.5	0.9	I,
0.5	0.3	"he's
0.3	0.8	ALIVE

0.4	0.3	
1	0.1	Closing
0.1	0.4	the
0.7	0.7	door
0.8	0.5	upon
0.5	0.4	the
0.3	0.7	landlady,
0.7	0.1	I
0.3	0.9	endeavored
0.2	0.9	to
0.3	0.3	prevail
0.3	0.2	upon
0.1	0.2	Queequeg

0.6	0.9	
0.4	0.5	There
0.9	0.7	he
0.6	0.9	sat;
0.1	0.8	and
0	0.9	all
0.7	0.3	he
0.3	0.3	could
0.2	0.2	do--for
0.3	0.1	all
0	0.4	my
0.4	0.9	polite
0.6	0.6	arts
0	0.7	and
0.8	0.7	blandishments--he
0.8	0.2	would
0.3	0.9	not

0.3	0.6	a

0.9	0.9	nor

0.4	0.3	even
0.7	0.3	look

0.1	0	in
1	0.8	the
0.6	0.5	slightest
0.3	0.9	way.
0.8	0.8	
0.6	0.4	I
0.4	0.4	wonder,
0.2	0.7	thought
0.7	0.1	I,
0.9	0.1	if
0.5	0.8	this
0.7	0.8	can
1	0.2	possibly
0.5	0.2	be
0.7	0.5	a
0.8	0.5	part
0.9	0.7	of
0.9	0.1	his
0.3	0.3	Ramadan;
0.6	0.3	do
0.9	0.9	they
0.8	0.4	fast
0.5	0.6	on
0.7	0.1	their
0.7	0.5	hams
0.3	0.1	that
0.5	0.5	way
0.4	0.7	in
0.4	0.5	his
0.7	0	native
0.1	0.1	island.
1	0.7	
0.4	0.6	It
0.5	0.4	must
0.4	0.6	be
0.7	0.4	so;
0.7	0.1	yes,
0.1	0.4	it's
0.2	0.4	part
0.1	0	of
0.6	0.5	his
0.5	0.6	creed,
0.2	0.7	I
0.9	0.7	suppose;
0	0	well,
0.9	0.2	then,
0.7	0.7	let
0.1	0	him
0.7	0.1	rest;
0.1	0.8	he'll
0.5	0	get
0.8	0.4	up
0.8	1	sooner
0.8	0.2	or
0.8	0.6	later,
0.8	0.8	no
0.9	0.3	doubt.
1	0	
0.2	0.6	It
0.9	0.1	can't
0	0.2	last
0.3	0.1	for
0.3	0.4	ever,
0.4	0.7	thank
0.4	0.9	God,
0.9	1	and
0.8	1	his
0.9	0.6	Ramadan
0.1	0	only
0.3	0.4	comes
0.9	0.6	once
0.2	0.1	a
0	0	year;
0.3	0.4	and
0.8	0.7	I
0.6	0.4	don't
0.6	0.1	believe
0.9	0.2	it's
0.8	0.1	very
0.8	0.1	punctual
0.1	0	then.
0.7	0.7	
0	0.4	I
0.3	0.7	went
0.5	0.5	down
0.9	0	to
0.2	0.8	supper.
0.5	0	
0.1	0.3	After
0.1	0.6	sitting
0.1	0.5	a
0.6	0.4	long
0.3	0.2	time
0.5	0.8	listening
0.6	0.1	to
0.1	0.4	the
0.5	0.3	long
0.6	0	stories
0.3	0.3	of
0.8	0.2	some
0.2	0.7	sailors
0.9	0.4	who
0.3	0.6	had
0.1	0.6	just
0.4	0.6	come
0.6	1	from
0.3	0.9	a
0.5	0.4	plum-pudding
0.6	0.9	voyage,
0.7	0.3	as
0.9	0.4	they
0	0.9	called
0.7	0.3	it
0.1	0.2	(that
0.8	0.8	is,
0.3	0.9	a
0.5	0.5	short
0.8	0	whaling-voyage
0.3	0.6	in
0.5	0.8	a
0.5	0.3	schooner
0.2	0.5	or

0.7	0.8	confined
0.2	0.5	to
0.9	0.3	the

1	1	of
0.6	0.5	the
0.1	0.7	line,
0.8	0.4	in
0.2	0.9	the
0.8	0.7	Atlantic
0.3	0.4	Ocean
0.1	0.8	only);
0.3	0.3	after
0.1	0.5	listening
0.8	0.2	to
0.7	0.7	these
0.9	0.8	plum-puddingers
0.1	0.7	till
0.8	0.1	nearly
0.1	0.3	eleven
0.1	0.3	o'clock,
0.2	0.1	I
1	0.6	went
0.6	0.8	up
0.7	0.7	stairs
0.9	0.6	to
0.7	0.5	go
0	0.9	to
0.6	1	bed,
0.7	0.8	feeling
0.1	0.7	quite
0.7	0.1	sure
0.2	0.1	by
0.1	0	this
0.7	0.2	time
0.3	0.3	Queequeg
0.7	0.6	must
0.4	0.8	certainly
0.1	0.5	have
0.3	0.8	brought
0.8	0.3	his
0	0.5	Ramadan
0.8	0.2	to
0.3	0.7	a
0.1	0.5	termination.
0.6	0.8	
0.5	0.2	But
0.4	0.8	no;
0.8	0.2	there
0.3	0.9	he
1	0.1	was
0.1	0.1	just
0.6	0.8	where
0.1	0.5	I
0.6	0.8	had
0.4	0.7	left
0.8	0.9	him;
0.8	0	he
0.1	0.5	had
0.7	0.4	not
0.6	0.3	stirred
0.2	0.1	an
0.9	0.6	inch.
0.8	0.9	
0.6	0.4	I
0.5	0.8	began
0.8	0.1	to
0.5	0.6	grow
0.5	0.9	vexed
1	0.2	with
0.9	0.4	him;
0.3	0.2	it
0.1	0.2	seemed
0	0.8	so
0.6	0.2	downright
0.7	0.4	senseless
0.9	0.8	and
0.8	0.3	insane
0.8	0.1	to
0	0.5	be
0.3	0.9	sitting
0.5	0.9	there
0.9	1	all
0.6	0.2	day
0.7	0.3	and
0.9	0.1	half
0.5	0.1	the
0.1	0.1	night
0.3	0.1	on
0.6	0.2	his
0.9	0.6	hams
0.6	0.2	in
0.4	0.3	a
0.6	0.6	cold
0.9	0.5	room,
0.7	0.5	holding
0.3	0.1	a
0.1	0.7	piece
0.5	0.3	of
0.1	0.7	wood
0.8	0.9	on
0.2	0.3	his
0.6	0.5	head.
0	0.9	
1	0.8	"For
0.2	0.1	heaven's
1	0.6	sake,
0.7	0.3	Queequeg,
0.2	0.7	get
0.6	0.2	up
0.5	0.6	and
0.6	0.6	shake
0.8	0.5	yourself;
0.6	0.4	get
0.1	0.1	up
0.1	0.4	and
0.3	0.2	have
1	0.7	some
0.4	0.8	supper.
0.4	0.3	
0.2	0.7	You'll
0.4	0.1	starve;
0.7	0.4	you'll
0.2	0.2	kill
0.2	0.4	yourself,
0.1	0.3	Queequeg."
0.5	0.7	But
1	0.6	not
0.4	0	a
0.1	1	word
0.2	0.9	did
0	0.4	he
0.1	0.4	reply.
0	0.2	
0.5	0.1	Despairing
0.7	0.8	of
1	0	him,
0.2	0.8	therefore,
0.2	0.4	I
0.1	0.2	determined
0.1	0.3	to
0.3	0.1	go
0.1	0.2	to
0.6	0	bed
0.2	0.5	and
0.5	1	to
0.2	0.9	sleep;
0.4	0.2	and
0.5	0.3	no
0.7	0.9	doubt,
0.3	0.3	before
0.9	0.4	a
0.3	0.4	great
0.4	0.5	while,
0.3	0.4	he
0.2	0.8	would
0.6	0.3	follow
0.2	0.3	me.
0.4	0.6	
0.2	0.8	But
0.1	0.2	previous
0.2	0	to
0.8	0.2	turning
0.1	0.6	in,
0.9	0.6	I
1	0.2	took
0.5	0.9	my
0.1	0.1	heavy
0	0.4	bearskin
0.3	0.9	jacket,
0.9	0.5	and
0.9	0.6	threw
0.9	0.1	it
0.3	0.5	over
0.7	0.2	him,
0.4	0.3	as
0.8	0.1	it
0.8	0.5	promised
0.8	0.4	to
0.7	0.3	be
0.9	0.5	a
0.8	0.6	very
1	0.4	cold
0	0.3	night;
0.7	0.8	and
0.1	0.6	he
0.3	0.7	had
0.5	0.9	nothing
0.3	0.8	but
0.3	0.7	his
0.9	0.6	ordinary
0.6	0.6	round
0.4	0.6	jacket
0.6	1	on.
0.7	0.1	
0.1	0.7	For
0.5	0.3	some
0.2	0.2	time,
0.6	0.5	do
0.8	1	all
0.7	0.8	I
0.3	0.6	would,
0.4	0.9	I
1	0.6	could
0.8	0.2	not
0.1	0.8	get
0.9	0	into
0.8	0.5	the
0.8	0.2	faintest
0.8	0.8	doze.
0.2	0.9	
0.2	0.3	I
0	0.5	had
0	0.4	blown
0.6	0.8	out
0.6	1	the
0.7	0.8	candle;
0.3	0.4	and
0.8	0.7	the
0.9	0.3	mere
0.8	0.9	thought
0.7	0.1	of
0.9	0.7	Queequeg--not
0.7	0.6	four
0.7	0.6	feet
0.7	0.6	off--sitting
0.7	0.1	there
0.1	0.5	in
0.8	0.6	that
0.7	0.1	uneasy
0.2	0.2	position,
0.3	0.9	stark
0.7	0.6	alone
0	0.5	in
0.7	0.6	the
0	0.7	cold
0.6	0.8	and
0.9	0.2	dark;
0.1	0.8	this
0.8	0.7	made
0.1	0.6	me
0.2	0.5	really
0.6	1	wretched.
0.9	0.9	
1	0.7	Think
0.5	1	of
0.3	0.7	it;
0.3	0.5	sleeping
0	0.4	all
0.6	0	night
0.5	0.6	in
0.2	1	the
0.9	0.5	same
0.7	0.9	room
0.8	0.8	with
0.4	0.6	a
0.9	0.2	wide
0.2	0.7	awake
0	0.5	pagan
0.4	0.1	on
0.5	0	his
0.1	0.8	hams
0.8	0.7	in
0.9	0.9	this
0.7	0.4	dreary,
0.3	0.3	unaccountable
0.1	0.9	Ramadan!
0.2	0.3	
0.1	0.4	But
0.6	0.8	somehow
0.7	0.8	I
0.6	0.1	dropped
0.7	0.6	off
0.8	0.5	at
0.1	0.7	last,
0.3	0.6	and
1	0.5	knew
1	0.3	nothing
0.3	0.5	more
0.4	0.3	till
0.4	0.2	break
0.8	0.7	of
0.2	0	day;
1	0.3	when,
0.3	0.3	looking
0.5	0.8	over
0.6	0.6	the
0.8	0.7	bedside,
0.1	1	there
0.4	0	squatted
1	0.6	Queequeg,
0.1	0.9	as
0.2	0.1	if
0.9	0.1	he
0.8	1	had
0.3	0.8	been
0.8	0.9	screwed
0.2	0.2	down
0.5	0.6	to
0.3	0.9	the
0.2	0.9	floor.
0.5	0.3	
0	0.8	But
0	0.8	as
0.9	0.8	soon
0.1	0.5	as
0.3	0.1	the
0.9	0.5	first
0.4	0.5	glimpse
0.2	0.2	of
0	0.6	sun
0.1	0.2	entered
0.8	1	the
0.4	0.3	window,
1	0.2	up
0.1	0.3	he
0.3	0.6	got,
0.5	0.8	with
0.1	0	stiff
0.7	0.3	and
0.5	0.7	grating
0.1	0.1	joints,
0.6	0.9	but
0.3	0.1	with
0.6	0.9	a
0.1	0.5	cheerful
0.3	0.3	look;
0.4	0.6	limped
0.8	0.9	towards
0.7	0.4	me
0.1	0.6	where
0.2	0.3	I
0.2	0.5	lay;
0.2	0.6	pressed
0.8	0.4	his
0.1	0.6	forehead
0.6	0.7	again
0.8	0.5	against
0.9	0.6	mine;
0.9	0.4	and
0.4	1	said
1	0.8	his
1	0.5	Ramadan
0.1	0.7	was
0.5	0.8	over.
0.1	0.8	
0.3	0.5	Now,
0.9	0.3	as
0.2	0.6	I
0.1	0.2	before
0.3	0.1	hinted,
0.2	0.4	I
0.1	0.6	have
0.9	0.8	no
0.6	0	objection
0.7	0.7	to
0.2	0.6	any
0.6	0	person's
0.2	0.8	religion,
0.5	1	be
0.3	0.8	it
0.7	1	what
0.6	0.8	it
0.4	0.5	may,
0.8	0	so
0.6	0.6	long
0.9	0.9	as
0.3	0.6	that
0.8	0	person
0.7	0.9	does
0.6	0.2	not
0.7	0.3	kill
0.2	0.8	or
0.3	0.6	insult
0	0.8	any
0	0.2	other
0.7	0.3	person,
0.8	0.7	because
0	0.2	that
0.4	0.5	other
0.4	0.6	person
0.2	0.4	don't
0.7	0.2	believe
0.8	0	it
0.9	0.5	also.
1	0.8	
0.2	0.3	But
0.5	0.9	when
0.7	0.6	a
0.1	0.9	man's
0.6	0.2	religion
0.8	0.3	becomes
0.2	0.3	really
0.5	0.4	frantic;
0.9	1	when
0.5	0.8	it
0.8	0.2	is
0.8	0.8	a
0.1	0.6	positive
0.8	0.8	torment
0.1	0.4	to
0.8	0.1	him;
0.8	0.8	and,
0.4	0.5	in
0.3	0.4	fine,
0	0.1	makes
1	0.9	this
0.7	0.1	earth
0.9	0.1	of
0.9	0.5	ours
0.6	0.6	an
0.8	0.7	uncomfortable
0.4	0.7	inn
0.9	0.5	to
0.3	0.4	lodge
0.5	0.6	in;
0.3	0.4	then
0.5	0.3	I
1	0.7	think
0.2	0.6	it
0.1	0.8	high
0.4	0.9	time
0.9	0.8	to
1	0	take
0.7	0.8	that
0.3	0	individual
0.5	0.7	aside
0.7	0.9	and
0.5	0.6	argue
0.4	0.9	the
0.1	0.1	point
0.6	0.6	with
0.1	0.2	him.
0.7	0.7	
0.7	0.4	And
0.6	0.8	just
0.3	1	so
0.8	0.5	I
0.6	0.5	now
0.1	0.5	did
0.4	0.2	with
0.1	0.5	Queequeg.
0	0.1	
0.1	0.9	"Queequeg,"
0.1	0.6	said
0	0.3	I,
0.6	0.6	"get
0.9	0.5	into
0.2	0.1	bed
0.9	1	now,
0.5	0.7	and
0.8	0.1	lie
0.8	0.5	and
0.8	0.9	listen
0.3	0.2	to
0.2	0.2	me."
0.7	0.1	
0.8	0.4	I
0.8	0.8	then
0.5	0.5	went
0.3	0.5	on,
0.2	0.7	beginning
0.7	0.1	with
0.6	0.6	the
0.7	0.4	rise
0.5	0.9	and
0	0.1	progress
0.1	0.5	of
0.5	0.5	the
0.3	0.6	primitive
0.8	0.4	religions,
0.9	0.7	and
0.8	0.7	coming
0.7	1	down
0.6	0.3	to
0.8	0.9	the
0.8	0.9	various
0.4	0.4	religions
0.2	0.7	of
0.9	0.6	the
0.1	0.5	present
0.1	0.1	time,
0.5	1	during
0.2	0.2	which
0.7	0.7	time
0.1	0.5	I
0.1	0.5	labored
0.3	0.3	to
0.6	0.7	show
0.5	0.3	Queequeg
0.2	0.7	that
0.1	0.8	all
0.7	0.2	these
0.8	0.2	Lents,
0.9	0.9	Ramadans,
0.1	0.9	and
0.1	0.2	prolonged
0.8	0.6	ham-squattings
0.7	0.8	in
0.9	0.7	cold,
0.5	0.3	cheerless
0.8	0.1	rooms
0.5	0.4	were
0.7	0.2	stark
0.5	0.1	nonsense;
0.8	0.2	bad
0.1	0.6	for
0.8	0.3	the
0.7	0.1	health;
0.6	0.7	useless
0.8	0.7	for
0.5	0.5	the
0.9	0.5	soul;
0.1	0.4	opposed,
1	0.3	in
0.7	0.6	short,
0.3	0.8	to
0.5	0.6	the
0.2	0.1	obvious
0.7	0.1	laws
0.5	0.8	of
0.5	0.4	Hygiene
0.6	0.1	and
0.2	0.3	common
0.4	0.6	sense.
0.2	0	
0.6	0.7	I
0.3	0.9	told
0.9	0.9	him,
1	0.3	too,
0.5	0.5	that
0.5	0.9	he
0.5	0.3	being
0.9	0.7	in
0.9	0	other
0.7	0.7	things
0.9	0.6	such
0.1	0.7	an
0.1	1	extremely
0.1	0.5	sensible
0.4	0.5	and
0.4	0.2	sagacious
0.2	0.6	savage,
0.6	0.6	it
0.9	0.9	pained
0.1	0.3	me,
0.9	0.6	very
0	0.9	badly
0.5	1	pained
0.9	0.7	me,
0.9	0.4	to
0.4	0.3	see
0.2	0	him
0.7	0.5	now
0.3	0	so
0.4	0	deplorably
0.6	0.6	foolish
0.5	0.5	about
0.6	0.1	this
0.8	0.8	ridiculous
0.7	0.3	Ramadan
0.8	0.5	of
0.9	1	his.
0.6	0.7	
0.5	0.9	Besides,
0.8	0.3	argued
0.4	0.3	I,
0.2	0.4	fasting
0.1	0.3	makes
0.2	0.6	the
0.3	0.3	body
0.8	0.3	cave
0.4	0.8	in;
0.7	0.8	hence
0.3	0.5	the
0.5	0.2	spirit
0.3	0.6	caves
0.8	0.1	in;
0.1	0.1	and
0.1	0.1	all
0.8	0.2	thoughts
0.6	0.8	born
0.8	0.3	of
0.3	0.5	a
0.3	0.2	fast
0.8	0.8	must
0.8	0.8	necessarily
0.6	0.5	be
1	0.3	half-starved.
0.5	0	This
0.1	0.4	is
1	0.5	the
0.5	0.7	reason
0.3	0.3	why
0.6	0.1	most
0.5	0.6	dyspeptic
0.1	0.5	religionists
0.3	0.1	cherish
0.2	0.8	such
0.2	0.3	melancholy
0.3	0.6	notions
0.3	0.3	about
0.8	1	their
0.4	0.8	hereafters.
0.9	0.5	
0.9	0.1	In
0.2	0.9	one
0	0.3	word,
0.4	0.9	Queequeg,
0.2	0.3	said
0.2	0.1	I,
0.3	0.5	rather
0	0.4	digressively;
0.4	0.6	hell
0.5	0.6	is
0	0.9	an
0.2	0.3	idea
0.2	0.4	first
0.7	0.7	born
0.1	0.5	on
0.9	0	an
1	0.3	undigested
0	0.4	apple-dumpling;
0.3	0.3	and
0.7	0.8	since
0.8	0.1	then
0.4	0.8	perpetuated
0.7	0	through
0.3	0.7	the
0.5	0.9	hereditary
0.7	0.4	dyspepsias
0.6	0.8	nurtured
0.8	0.3	by
0.5	0.1	Ramadans.
0.1	0.9	
0.3	0.8	I
0.8	0.8	then
0.6	0.9	asked
0.5	0.5	Queequeg
0.6	0.1	whether
0.5	0.6	he
0.5	1	himself
0	0.2	was
0.2	0.8	ever
0.1	0.8	troubled
0.6	0.2	with
0.6	0.5	dyspepsia;
0	0.9	expressing
0.8	0.8	the
0.5	0.5	idea
0.2	0.8	very
0.9	0.2	plainly,
0.3	0.9	so
0.8	0.6	that
1	0.9	he
0.2	0.9	could
0.6	0.5	take
0.9	0.2	it
0.9	0	in.
0.4	0.8	
0.2	0.3	He
0.2	0.3	said
0.1	0.7	no;
0.8	0.7	only
0.7	0.7	upon
0.5	0.1	one
0.3	0.5	memorable
0.1	0.9	occasion.
0	0.5	
0.9	0.7	It
0.7	0.2	was
0.3	0.4	after
0.3	0.4	a
0.1	0.9	great
0.2	0.8	feast
0.7	0.9	given
0.5	0.7	by
0.9	0.1	his
0.3	0.5	father
0.5	0.8	the
0.9	0.6	king,
0.8	0	on
0.5	0.5	the
0.3	0.9	gaining
0.2	0.9	of
0.4	0.5	a
0.6	0.6	great
0.7	0.9	battle
0.6	0.2	wherein
0.6	0.3	fifty
0.4	0.7	of
0.7	1	the
0.9	0.6	enemy
0.2	1	had
0.5	0	been
0.9	0.5	killed
0.1	0.7	by
0.5	0.3	about
0.1	1	two
0.7	0.2	o'clock
0.6	0.2	in
0.2	0.2	the
0.2	0.6	afternoon,
0.7	0.7	and
0.7	0.1	all
0.5	0.3	cooked
0.9	0.4	and
0.7	0.3	eaten
0.3	0.7	that
0.1	0.1	very
0.4	0.2	evening.
0.9	0.9	
0.3	0.7	"No
0.4	0.5	more,
0.3	0.3	Queequeg,"
0.5	0.9	said
0.2	0.3	I,
1	0.8	shuddering;
0.9	0.7	"that
0.1	0.8	will
0.2	0.4	do;"
0.6	0.7	for
0.9	0.5	I
0.6	0.1	knew
0.9	0.5	the
0.4	0.6	inferences
0.1	0.3	without
0.7	0.6	his
0.9	1	further
0	0.8	hinting
0.1	0.1	them.
0.1	0.1	
0	0.4	I
0.1	0.1	had
0.1	0.7	seen
0.9	0.7	a
0.2	0.2	sailor
1	0.4	who
0	0.9	had
0.8	0.6	visited
1	0.1	that
0.1	0.8	very
0.4	0	island,
0.3	1	and
0.5	0	he
0.1	0.2	told
0.2	0.4	me
0.6	0.5	that
0.2	0.6	it
0.3	0.8	was
0.9	0.4	the
0.9	0.5	custom,
0.4	0.2	when
0.2	0.4	a
0.5	0.1	great
0.7	0.4	battle
0.1	0.7	had
0.2	0.3	been
0.6	0.6	gained
0.3	0.1	there,
0.1	0.3	to
0.3	0.7	barbecue
0.2	0.9	all
0.2	0.2	the
0.3	0.4	slain
0.1	0.1	in
0.2	0.6	the
0.2	0.5	yard
0.8	0.4	or
0.5	0.6	garden
0.7	0.3	of
0.8	0.4	the
0.5	0.5	victor;
0	0.6	and
0.8	0.1	then,
0.9	0	one
0.6	0.2	by
0.1	0.8	one,
0.4	0.6	they
0.2	0.3	were
0.3	0.7	placed
0.1	0.5	in
0	0.3	great
0.9	0.4	wooden
0.7	0.4	trenchers,
0.2	0.6	and
0.1	0.1	garnished
0.6	0.3	round
0.8	0.5	like
0.9	0.4	a
0.1	0.9	pilau,
0.8	0.5	with
0.8	0.8	breadfruit
0.9	0.8	and
0.7	0.2	cocoanuts;
0.5	0.4	and
0.3	0.4	with
0.8	0.5	some
0.6	0.3	parsley
0.8	0.3	in
0.6	0.1	their
0.2	0.3	mouths,
0.4	0.6	were
0.5	0.4	sent
0.3	0.6	round
0.5	1	with
0.1	0.7	the
0.5	0.6	victor's
0.6	0.8	compliments
0.9	0.7	to
0.8	0.7	all
0.8	0.4	his
0.5	0.3	friends,
0.8	0.9	just
0.8	0.9	as
0.2	0.9	though
0.9	0.1	these
0	0.4	presents
0.3	0.4	were
0.2	0.7	so
0.6	0.9	many
0.5	0.8	Christmas
0.8	0.4	turkeys.
0.4	0.1	
0.5	0.8	After
0.1	0.3	all,
0.6	0.7	I
0.8	0.2	do
0.7	0.9	not
0.1	0.8	think
0.5	0.2	that
0.1	0.1	my
0.7	0.9	remarks
0.9	0.9	about
0.7	0.5	religion
0.3	0.6	made
0.8	0.8	much
0.1	0.2	impression
0.6	0.3	upon
0	0.9	Queequeg.
0.1	0.7	
0.8	0.5	Because,
0.6	0.9	in
0.3	0.5	the
0.8	0.7	first
0.3	0.4	place,
0.7	0.3	he
0.3	0	somehow
0.1	0.9	seemed
0.1	0.9	dull
0.3	0.5	of
0.1	0	hearing
0.2	0.6	on
0.1	0.6	that
0.2	0.3	important
0.6	0.6	subject,
0.7	0.2	unless
0.7	0.3	considered
0.2	0.2	from
0.7	0.4	his
0.9	0.5	own
0.1	0.2	point
0.6	0.6	of
0.3	0.3	view;
0.5	0.4	and,
0.7	0.9	in
0.8	0.9	the
0.6	0.2	second
0.1	0.1	place,
0.8	0.4	he
0.3	0.2	did
0.9	0.6	not
0.3	0.5	more
0.6	0.8	than
0.8	0	one
0.8	0.6	third
0.8	0.7	understand
0.9	0.1	me,
0.1	0.5	couch
0.5	0.4	my
0.9	0.3	ideas
0.8	0.1	simply
0.5	0.6	as
0.1	0.2	I
0.1	0.1	would;
0.1	0.7	and,
0.8	0.1	finally,
0.3	0.6	he
0.5	0.5	no
0.1	1	doubt
0.3	1	thought
0	0.9	he
0.2	0.2	knew
1	0.1	a
0.5	0.6	good
0.5	0.2	deal
1	0.4	more
0.8	0.8	about
0	0.6	the
0.5	0.9	true
0.4	0.3	religion
0.3	0.2	than
0.7	0.9	I
0.1	0.2	did.
0.6	0.6	
0.7	0.9	He
0.1	0.9	looked
0.2	0.7	at
0.4	0.3	me
0.4	0.3	with
0.2	0.3	a
0.7	0.8	sort
0.2	0.5	of
0.1	1	condescending
0.5	0.7	concern
0.3	0.3	and
0.4	0.1	compassion,
0.4	0.7	as
0.3	0.3	though
0.5	0.7	he
0.3	0.6	thought
0.4	0.7	it
0.3	0.4	a
1	0	great
0.9	0.2	pity
0	0.6	that
0.2	0.4	such
0.8	1	a
0.6	0.1	sensible
0.2	0.7	young
0.3	0.2	man
0.3	0.1	should
0	0.6	be
0.9	0.8	so
0.2	0.1	hopelessly
0.6	0.6	lost
0.8	0.3	to
0.9	0.2	evangelical
0.7	0.2	pagan
0.3	0.6	piety.
0.5	0.6	
0.6	0.7	At
0.3	1	last
0.3	0.5	we
0.8	0.7	rose
0.9	0.9	and
0.8	0.3	dressed;
0.8	0.1	and
1	0.9	Queequeg,

0.7	0.5	of

0.4	1	of
0.1	0.7	all
0.7	0.9	sorts,
0.4	0.4	so
0.1	0.7	that
0.7	0	the
0.1	0	landlady
0.3	0.7	should
0	0.5	not
0.8	0.5	make

0.9	0.3	reason
0	1	of

0.3	1	we

0.2	0.8	and
0.7	0.6	looking

0.6	0.7	
0.5	0.6	I

0.8	0.1	whether
0.6	0.8	this

1	0.8	During

0.8	0.1	of
0.7	0	preparation,
0.7	0.1	Queequeg
0.1	0.3	and
0.1	0.4	I
0.1	0.1	often
0.1	0.3	visited
1	0.4	the
0.2	0.3	craft,
0.2	0.8	and
0.7	0.8	as
0.3	0.4	often
0.7	0.6	I
0.8	0.8	asked
0.8	0.6	about
0.7	0.2	Captain
0.6	0.2	Ahab,
0.8	0.9	and
0.4	0.8	how
0.1	0.6	he
0.6	0.8	was,
0.3	0.3	and
0.7	0.5	when
0.5	0.9	he
0.1	0.4	was
0	0.5	going

0.5	0.2	
0.3	0.8	To
0.2	0.3	these
0.8	0.5	questions
1	0.9	they
0.8	0.7	would
0.4	0.5	answer,
0.4	0.8	that
0.2	0.5	he
1	0.3	was
0.4	0	getting
0.6	0.4	better
0.6	0.6	and
0.9	0.2	better,
0.1	0.6	and
1	0.1	was
0.1	0	expected
0.6	0.5	aboard
0.3	0.2	every
0.9	0.6	day;
0	0.9	meantime,
0.4	0.3	the
1	0.6	two
0.5	0.4	captains,
0	0.8	Peleg
0.3	0.5	and
0.6	0.1	Bildad,
0.8	0.1	could
0.5	1	attend
0.2	0.5	to
0.9	0.2	everything
0.7	0.6	necessary
0.4	0.2	to
0.3	0.2	fit
0.4	0	the
0.7	0.4	vessel
0.3	0.3	for
0.7	0.1	the
0.7	0.8	voyage.
0.3	0.7	
0.2	0.5	If
0.1	0.4	I
0.7	0.2	had
0.6	0.3	been
0.3	0	downright
0.7	0.1	honest
0.2	0.3	with
0.7	0.6	myself,
0.8	0.3	I
0.4	0.3	would
0.1	0.9	have
0.7	0.3	seen
0.1	0.7	very
0.4	0	plainly
0.2	0.6	in
0.8	0.3	my
0.6	0.4	heart
0.3	0.4	that
0.8	0.8	I
0.4	0.9	did
0.1	0.1	but
0.9	0.3	half
0.2	0.4	fancy
0.3	0.9	being
0.1	0.2	committed
0.1	0.1	this
0.8	0.6	way
0.9	0.1	to
0.1	0.2	so
0.2	0.3	long
0.4	0.7	a
0.7	0	voyage,
0.1	0.1	without
0.4	0.7	once
0.3	0.1	laying
0.3	0.2	my
0.7	0.4	eyes
0.5	0.4	on
0.2	0.7	the
0.1	0.7	man
0.6	0.6	who
0.6	0.7	was
0.8	0.4	to
0.6	0.5	be
0.1	0.3	the
0.3	0.9	absolute
0.9	0.4	dictator
0.3	0.7	of
0.1	0.3	it,
0.5	0.5	so
1	0.7	soon
0.6	0.5	as
0.9	0	the
0.9	0.3	ship
0.8	0.3	sailed
0.3	0.7	out
0.6	0.9	upon
0.5	0.4	the
0.4	0.2	open
0.5	0.6	sea.
0.1	0	
0	0	But
0.2	0.9	when
0.3	0.2	a
0.5	0.3	man
0.6	0.1	suspects
0.2	0.6	any
0.4	0.1	wrong,
0.9	0.7	it
0.3	0	sometimes
0.9	0.3	happens
0.6	0.1	that
0.7	0.5	if
0	0.5	he
0.2	0.6	be
0.7	0.5	already
0.5	0.7	involved
0.3	0.9	in
0	0.5	the
0.5	0.6	matter,
0.3	0.2	he
0.3	0	insensibly
0.2	0.5	strives
0.5	0.6	to
0.4	0.9	cover
0.8	0.1	up
0.1	0.8	his
0.2	0.5	suspicions
0.8	0.9	even
0.9	0.3	from
0.9	0.8	himself.
0	0.2	
0.6	0.7	And
0.4	0.8	much
0.1	0.8	this

0.7	0.9	it
0.4	0	was
0.3	0.7	with
0	0.3	me.
0.3	0.5	
0.2	0.5	I
0.3	0.8	said
0.6	0.8	nothing,
1	0.8	and
0.9	0.1	tried
0.8	0.8	to
0.1	0.8	think
0.9	0.7	nothing.
0.4	0.3	
0.5	0.8	At
0.9	0	last
0.4	1	it
0.3	0.2	was

0.1	0.2	the

0.1	0.2	next

0.7	0.9	Queequeg
0.4	0.9	and
0.7	0.5	I

0.3	0.5	forecastle,
0.1	0.5	we
0.2	0	found
0.1	0.4	the
0.6	0.4	slide
0.9	0.7	of
0.3	0.3	the
0.5	1	scuttle
0.3	0.2	open.
0.7	0	
0.2	0.6	Seeing
0.1	0.1	a
0	0.8	light,
0.7	0.8	we
0.9	0.3	went
0.3	0.4	down,
0.1	0.7	and
0.2	0.3	found
0.6	0.7	only
0.9	0.2	an
0.3	0.6	old
0.8	0.1	rigger
0.4	0	there,
0.6	0.2	wrapped
0.7	0.6	in
0.7	0.1	a
0.2	0.1	tattered
0.7	0.3	pea-jacket.
0.3	0.2	
0.3	0.3	He
0.9	0.7	was
0.5	0.6	thrown
0.6	0.2	at
0.2	0.2	whole
0.8	0	length
1	0.6	upon
0.2	0.3	two
0.5	0.1	chests,
0.3	0.3	his

0.4	0.4	downwards
0.3	0.4	and
0.4	0.3	inclosed
0.3	0.5	in
0.2	0.6	his

0.8	0.1	arms.
0.8	1	
0.8	0.7	The
0	0.2	profoundest
0.4	0.8	slumber
0.6	0.7	slept
0.9	0.5	upon
1	0.3	him.
0.1	0.3	
0.1	0.9	"Those
0.6	0.8	sailors
0.5	0	we

0.5	0.2	said
0.5	0.2	I,
0.6	0.2	looking
0.4	0.3	dubiously
0.7	0.9	at
0.4	0.8	the
0.9	0.7	sleeper.
0.5	0.2	
0.3	0.2	But
0.5	0.3	it
0.4	0.2	seemed
0.7	0.2	that,
0.5	0.9	when
0.2	0.2	on
0.8	0.7	the
0.2	0.6	wharf,
0.1	0.6	Queequeg

0.9	0.9	I
0.9	1	now
0.7	0.8	alluded
0.7	0.4	to;
0.8	0.7	hence
0.1	0.3	I
1	0.3	would
0	0.3	have
0.3	0.8	thought
0.6	0.9	myself
0.1	0.2	to
0.4	0.1	have
0.9	0.8	been
0.5	0.4	optically
0.2	0.9	deceived

0.6	0.5	otherwise
0.9	0.1	inexplicable
0.8	0.1	question.
0.1	0.9	But
0.4	0.8	I
0.6	0.3	beat
1	0.1	the
0.5	0.1	thing
0.7	0.9	down;
0	0.7	and
0.1	0.8	again
0.3	0.2	marking
0.9	0.1	the
0.7	0.8	sleeper,
0.8	0.6	jocularly
0.8	0.4	hinted
0.1	0.3	to
0.8	0.4	Queequeg
0.2	0	that
0.5	0.6	perhaps
1	0.1	we

0.8	0.5	telling
0.7	0.8	him
0.3	0.7	to

0.5	0.1	himself
0.9	0.4	accordingly.
1	0.3	
0.4	0.7	He
0	0.7	put
0.9	0	his
0.1	0.5	hand
0.4	0.4	upon
0.6	0.3	the
0.6	0.9	sleeper's
0.4	0.6	rear,
0.3	0.7	as
1	0.7	though
0.3	0.3	feeling
0.3	0.3	if
0.1	0.5	it
0.9	0.8	was
0.1	0.8	soft
0.6	0.2	enough;
1	0.8	and
0.4	0.1	then,
0	0.7	without
0.4	0.2	more
0.1	0.8	ado,
0.9	0.3	sat
0	0.4	quietly

0.9	0.2	"Gracious!

0.9	0.9	I

0.4	0.3	Captain
1	0.3	Ahab
0.6	0	is
0.6	0.8	all
0.8	0.7	ready--just
0.7	0.1	spoke

0.9	0.8	Well,

1	0.4	Here
0.5	0.4	upon
0.6	0.8	the
0.2	0.4	very
0.9	0.5	point
0.7	0.5	of
0.1	0.6	starting
0	0.7	for
0.9	1	the
0.3	0.5	voyage,
0.2	0.6	Captain
0.9	0.6	Peleg
0.1	0.2	and
1	0.3	Captain
0.3	0.3	Bildad
0.8	0.1	were
0.6	0.3	going
0.2	0.3	it
1	0.9	with
0.1	0.6	a
0.4	0.4	high
0.8	0.9	hand
0.4	0.4	on
0.3	0.8	the
0.9	0.6	quarter-deck,
0.7	0.7	just
0.6	1	as
0.3	1	if
0.7	0.8	they
0.9	0.2	were
0.4	0.1	to
0.8	0.5	be
0.2	0.7	joint-commanders
0.3	0.2	at
0.2	0.8	sea,
0.3	0.1	as
0.6	0.2	well
0.6	0.4	as
0.8	0.7	to
0.6	0.8	all
0.5	0.8	appearances
0.1	0.6	in
0.3	0.5	port.
0.3	0.2	
0.5	0.6	And,
0.9	0.3	as
0.2	0.6	for
0.8	0.2	Captain
0.5	0.3	Ahab,
0	0.2	no
0.2	0.8	sign
0.3	0.7	of
0.2	0.8	him
0.2	0.7	was
0.2	0.8	yet
0.2	0.2	to
0.3	0.6	be
0.6	0.8	seen;
0.7	0.4	only,
0.1	0.8	they
0.1	0	said
0.6	0.2	he
0.3	0.4	was
0.6	0.8	in
0.8	1	the
0.3	0.2	cabin.
0.9	0.4	But
0.5	0.9	then,
0.2	0.3	the
0.9	0.4	idea
0.4	0.8	was,
0.3	0.3	that
0.8	0.9	his
0.5	0	presence
0.5	0.9	was
0.9	0.5	by
0.8	1	no
0.5	0.8	means
0.3	0.9	necessary
0.6	0.8	in
0	0.3	getting
0.2	0.6	the
0.4	0.1	ship
0.1	0.8	under
0.9	0.5	weigh,
0.4	0.1	and
0.4	0.5	steering
0.1	0.3	her
0.3	0.4	well
0.8	0.7	out
0.4	0.4	to
0.6	0.1	sea.
0.9	0.6	Indeed,
0.9	0.7	as
0.3	0.9	that
0.1	0.3	was
0.2	0.9	not
0.1	0.3	at
0.5	0	all
1	0.8	his
0.9	0.4	proper
0.1	0	business,
0	0.6	but
0.5	0.4	the
0.1	0.2	pilot's;
0.8	0.4	and
0.9	0.2	as
0.9	0.4	he
0.8	1	was
0.9	0.3	not
0.1	0.6	yet
0.8	0.1	completely
0.7	0.4	recovered--so
0.5	0.3	they
0.2	0.7	said--therefore,
0.9	0.2	Captain
0.2	0.8	Ahab
0.6	0.5	stayed
0.7	0.5	below.
0.7	0.1	
0.9	0.6	And
0.6	0.9	all
0.1	0.1	this
0.1	0.5	seemed
0.5	0.8	natural
0.6	0.6	enough;
0.3	0.9	especially
0.4	0.1	as
0.8	0.1	in
0.2	0.8	the
0.1	0.6	merchant
0.5	0.1	service
0.3	0.1	many
0.4	0.2	captains
1	0.7	never
0.5	0.2	show
0.5	0.3	themselves
0.7	0.2	on
0.7	0.4	deck
0.9	0.6	for
0.5	0.1	a
0.2	0.9	considerable
0.8	0.2	time
0.9	0.9	after
0.8	0.5	heaving
0.5	0.1	up
0.1	0.8	the
0.6	0.3	anchor,
0.3	0.9	but
0.3	0.8	remain
0.9	0.9	over
0.5	0.9	the
0.6	0.7	cabin
0.2	0.1	table,
0.3	0.9	having
0.2	0.3	a
0.3	0.3	farewell
0.5	0.5	merry-making
0.9	0.5	with
0.6	0	their
0.2	1	shore
0.6	0.9	friends,
0.8	0.8	before
0.1	0.5	they
0.9	0.2	quit
0.3	0.8	the
0.3	0.8	ship
0.4	0.9	for
1	0.9	good
0.1	1	with
1	0.6	the
0.8	0	pilot.
0.2	0.8	
0.5	0.4	But
1	0.8	there
0.1	0.6	was
0.9	0.6	not
0.2	0.5	much
0.6	0.5	chance
0.8	0.5	to
0.4	0.3	think
0.5	0.1	over
0.5	0.8	the
0.6	0.3	matter,
0.5	0.8	for
0.3	0.7	Captain
0.7	0.5	Peleg
0.1	0.4	was
0.1	0.1	now
0.5	0.4	all
0.3	0.6	alive.
0.9	0.9	
0.9	0.9	He
0.3	0.7	seemed
0.6	0.1	to
0.2	0.2	do
0.6	0.8	most
0.2	0.8	of
0.8	0.9	the
0.9	0.3	talking
1	0.4	and

0.1	0.2	I

0.2	0.5	Every

0.1	0.4	
0.7	0.5	This

0.5	0.6	much
0.1	0.5	as
0.1	1	in
0.9	0.2	other

0.9	0.7	I

0.5	0.2	I
0.6	0.4	say,
0.8	0.4	that
0.1	0.2	though
0.3	0.9	the
0.3	0	Captain
0.9	0.6	is
0.6	0.7	very

0.1	0.1	and
0.1	0.7	scientific
0.3	0.6	here,
0.8	0.4	yet,
0	1	for
0.9	0.7	all
0.2	0.5	his

0.8	0.5	Captain
0.2	0.6	Sleet,
1	0.1	that
0.3	0.7	he

0.8	0.8	much
0.9	0.8	immersed

0.1	0.4	being

0.1	0.9	so
0.6	0.2	nicely

0.5	0.2	
0.8	0.2	Though,
1	0.5	upon
0.7	0.3	the
0.9	0.9	whole,
0.4	0.4	I
0.5	0.5	greatly
1	0.1	admire
0.7	0.5	and
0	0.4	even
0.1	0.9	love
0.4	0.4	the

0.4	0.5	the

0.5	0.2	ignore
0.7	0.7	that

0.2	0.1	seeing

0.8	0.2	and

0.3	0	it

0.5	1	fingers
1	0.2	and
0.1	0.8	hooded
0.3	0.3	head
0.6	0.8	he

0.4	0.8	
0.8	0.1	But

0.8	0.7	Sleet
0.3	0.1	and
0.7	0.1	his
0.5	0.9	Greenlandmen
0.6	0.7	were;
0.3	0.9	yet
0.5	0.7	that
0.8	0.9	disadvantage
0.6	0.8	is
0.8	0.4	greatly
0.5	0.3	counter-balanced
0.8	0.9	by
0.8	0.9	the

0.1	0.4	For

0.8	0.9	Ahab

0.1	0.8	
0.9	0.1	Yet
0.6	0.1	without

0.1	0.6	or

0.7	0.2	the

0.8	0	he

0.4	0.1	did

0.6	0.2	
0.9	0.1	But
0.3	0.8	that
0.4	0.6	thing
0	0.8	of
0.6	0.8	his
0.1	0.9	dissembling
0.5	0.1	was

0.6	0.6	saw.
0.9	0.6	
0.7	0.8	It

0.2	0.6	hard

0.2	0.9	From

0.2	0.3	
0.7	0.2	Wondrous

0.9	0.6	
0.8	0.1	Though
0.3	0.1	bodily

0.5	0.3	eyes,
0.4	0.9	methought
0.8	0.4	I

0.5	0.7	
0.2	0.5	As
0.5	0.7	Abraham
0.2	0.9	before
0.5	0.1	the
0.7	0.3	angels,
0.6	0.7	I
0.8	0.8	bowed
0.1	0.2	myself;
0.6	1	the
0.9	0.5	white
0.5	0	thing
0.2	0.5	was
0.2	0.5	so
0.1	0.7	white,
0.8	0.9	its
0.8	0.3	wings
0.1	0.8	so
0.1	0.7	wide,
0.8	0.4	and
0.3	0.6	in
0.6	0.2	those
0.9	0.5	for
0.9	0.6	ever
0.1	0.4	exiled
0.8	0.7	waters,
0.4	0.4	I
0.8	0.9	had
0.2	1	lost
0.1	0.5	the
0.3	1	miserable
0.5	0.1	warping
0.8	0.2	memories
0.8	0.1	of
0.6	0.3	traditions
0.8	0.7	and
0.3	0.2	of
0.5	0.6	towns.
0.8	0.6	
0.5	1	Long
0.5	0.9	I
0.7	0.2	gazed
0.1	0.5	at
1	0.5	that
0.4	0.9	prodigy
0.4	0.7	of
0.3	0.8	plumage.
1	0.2	
0.4	0.9	I
0.1	0.1	cannot
0.9	0.9	tell,
0.8	0.6	can
0.5	0.5	only
0.6	0.4	hint,
0.6	0.2	the
0.6	0.3	things
0.1	0.7	that
0.8	1	darted
0.2	0.4	through
0.8	0.7	me
0.2	0.5	then.
0.3	0.1	
0.8	0.1	But
0.8	0.3	at
1	1	last
0.1	0.8	I
0.1	0.8	awoke;
0.7	0.5	and
0.3	0.7	turning,
0.5	0.9	asked
0.7	0.9	a
0.1	0.8	sailor
0.5	0.5	what
0.1	0.3	bird
0.5	0.9	was
0.9	1	this.
0.8	0.8	
0.9	0.4	A
0.2	0.1	goney,
0.6	0.7	he
0.6	0.2	replied.
0.4	0.9	
0.1	0.2	Goney!
0.5	0.4	never
0.1	0.6	had
0.9	0.7	heard
0.1	0.9	that
0.8	0.9	name
1	0.9	before;
0.9	0.6	is
0.7	0.8	it
0.9	0.9	conceivable
0.2	0.5	that
0.1	0.9	this
0.9	0.3	glorious
0.9	0.2	thing
0.2	0.4	is
0.6	0.3	utterly
0.8	0.7	unknown
0.6	0.9	to
0.2	0.6	men
0.3	0.7	ashore!
0.8	0.7	never!
0.6	0.2	
0.3	0.7	But
0.9	0.5	some
0.5	0.4	time
0.7	0.7	after,
0.3	0.5	I
0.8	0.6	learned
0.5	0.9	that
0.3	1	goney
0.5	0.3	was
0	0.1	some
0.9	0.8	seaman's
0.5	0.9	name
0.1	0.3	for
0.7	0.5	albatross.
0.1	0.5	
0.4	0.8	So
0.6	0.1	that
0.2	0.8	by
0.5	0.2	no
0.6	0.4	possibility
0.9	0.6	could
0.3	0.7	Coleridge's
0.2	0.8	wild
0.1	0.4	Rhyme
0.5	0.4	have
0.7	0.5	had
0.7	0.8	aught
0.3	0.6	to
0.3	0.2	do
0.8	0.4	with
0.9	0.8	those
0.3	0.5	mystical
0.1	0.5	impressions
0.3	0.3	which
0.5	0.6	were
0.1	0.7	mine,
0.8	0.7	when
0.6	0.7	I
1	0.4	saw
0.1	0.2	that
0.5	0.3	bird
0.8	0.3	upon
0.7	0.4	our
0.1	0.8	deck.
0.7	0.6	
0.8	0.7	For
0.9	0.5	neither
0.9	0.7	had
0.7	0.9	I
0.2	0.7	then
0.8	0.3	read
0.6	0.4	the
0.7	0.5	Rhyme,
0.1	1	nor
0.6	0.1	knew
0.4	0.8	the
0.4	0.3	bird
0.8	0.8	to
0.7	0.3	be
0.2	0.4	an
0.8	0.2	albatross.
0.5	0.8	
1	0.1	Yet,
0.8	0.2	in
0.7	0.7	saying
0.5	1	this,
0.4	0.9	I
0.9	0.3	do
0.9	0	but
0.3	0.8	indirectly
0.9	0.5	burnish
0.1	0.9	a
0.9	0.2	little
0.7	0.8	brighter
0.5	0.9	the
0.9	0.7	noble
0.2	1	merit
0.3	0.7	of
1	0.4	the
0.8	0.8	poem
0.3	0.7	and
0.8	0.2	the
0.1	0.1	poet.
0.4	0.3	
0.5	1	I
0.2	0.7	assert,
0.6	0.9	then,
0.2	0.8	that
0.7	0.1	in
1	0.8	the
0.7	0.9	wondrous
0.9	0.3	bodily
0.4	0.6	whiteness
0.5	1	of
0.4	0.7	the
0.2	0.1	bird
0.6	0.6	chiefly
0.6	0.1	lurks
0.1	0.1	the
0.3	0.8	secret
0.5	0.6	of
0.2	0.2	the
0.3	0.4	spell;
0.8	0.1	a
0.1	0.1	truth
0.3	1	the
0.8	0.6	more
0.2	0.3	evinced
0.6	0.3	in
0.1	0.3	this,
0.7	1	that
0	0.7	by
0.4	0.2	a
0.4	0.9	solecism
0.8	0.5	of
0.4	0.6	terms
0.5	0.8	there
0.7	0.5	are
0.3	0.7	birds
0.6	0.3	called
0.4	0.5	grey
0.3	0.6	albatrosses;
0	0.2	and
0.7	0.5	these
0.3	0.2	I
0.1	0.1	have
0.4	0.7	frequently
0.8	0.9	seen,
0	0.7	but
0.8	0.1	never
0.3	0.8	with
0.3	0.6	such
0.8	0.4	emotions
0.7	0.6	as
0.4	0.6	when
0.3	0.3	I
0.4	0.9	beheld
0.7	0.7	the
0.9	1	Antarctic
0.2	0.7	fowl.
0.1	0.8	
0.3	0.5	But
0.4	0.4	how
0.2	0.3	had
0.2	0.1	the
0.3	0.1	mystic
0	0.4	thing
0.7	0.2	been
0.9	0.3	caught?
0.4	0.5	
0.7	0.5	Whisper
1	0.5	it
0.3	0.1	not,
0.3	0	and
0.6	0.5	I
0	0.9	will
0.6	0.9	tell;
0.2	0.2	with
0.6	0.5	a
0.4	0.6	treacherous
0	0.8	hook
0.8	0.6	and
0.5	0.6	line,
0.4	0.9	as

0.6	0.5	First:
0.3	0.9	The

0.5	0.9	starts
0.4	0.9	to
0.1	0.1	vigilance,
0.1	0.7	and
0.7	0.1	feels
0	0.8	just
0.3	0.2	enough
0.7	0.8	of

0.8	0.6	to
0.3	0.7	sharpen
0.5	0.6	all
0.9	0.1	his

0.3	0.4	but
0.5	0.7	under

0.9	0.2	let

0.7	0.4	a

0.9	0.6	superstitious
0.1	0	dread;
0.7	0.5	the

0.4	0.1	of
0.3	0.7	the
0.1	0.3	whitened

0.3	0.9	is
0.1	0.6	horrible
0.7	0.1	to
0.7	1	him
0.3	0.3	as

0.7	0.7	him
0.2	0.9	he

0.2	0.4	he

0.9	0.6	
0.2	0.7	Yet

0.6	0.5	In

0.3	0.9	
0.1	0.1	So

0.5	1	
0.8	0.9	So,

0.4	0.3	into
0.5	0.2	this

0.5	0.3	however
0.6	0.3	flattering
0.9	0	it

0.1	0.9	nor
0.6	0	in
0.3	0.9	the

0.6	0.9	all
0.6	0.5	intervening
1	0.5	quest.
0.8	0.1	
0.5	0.5	Now,
0.5	0.8	the
0.8	0	Pequod
0.6	0.7	had
0.1	0.3	sailed
0.9	0.3	from
0.2	0.6	Nantucket

0.6	0.8	
0.1	0.2	No
0.5	0.3	possible
0.7	0.2	endeavor
0.6	0.2	then
0.2	0.1	could
0.1	0.8	enable
0.7	0.6	her
0.9	0.6	commander
0.2	0.3	to
0.3	0.2	make
0.7	0.5	the

0.3	0.8	southwards,
0.8	0.9	double
0.9	0.5	Cape
0.2	0.7	Horn,
0.7	0.3	and
0.5	0	then
0.3	0.1	running

0.4	0.5	sixty
0	0.1	degrees
0.4	0.7	of

0.2	0.6	to
0.9	0.3	cruise
0.5	0.4	there.
0.6	0.7	
0.9	0.5	Therefore,
0.2	0.4	he
0.9	1	must
0.4	0.6	wait
0.6	0.6	for
0.3	0.7	the
0.9	0.1	next
0.8	0.2	ensuing
0.4	0.4	season.
0	0.4	
0.2	0.3	Yet
0.2	0.4	the

0.5	0.6	of
0.9	0.3	the
0.2	0.7	Pequod's

0.9	0.6	perhaps,
1	0.8	been

0.9	0.1	Ahab,
0.1	0.3	with
0.8	1	a

0.7	0.5	complexion
0.9	0.7	of

0.6	0.9	
0.8	0.6	Because,
0.1	0.9	an

0.5	0.8	of

0.3	0.9	hundred

0.7	0.9	an

0.9	0.2	which,
0.5	0.4	instead
0.5	0.5	of
0.6	0.4	impatiently
0.4	0.8	enduring
0.4	0.9	ashore,
1	0.5	he

0.2	0.2	spend
0.1	0.7	in

1	0.8	if

0.7	0.4

0.9	0.8	
0.2	0.3	First:
0.2	0.3	I
0.1	0	have
0.9	0.5	personally
0.7	0.1	known
1	0.3	three

0.3	0.1	escape;
0.5	0.4	and,
0.9	0.3	after
0.4	0.1	an
0.6	0.3	interval
0.3	0.4	(in
1	0.6	one
0.7	0.1	instance
0.1	0.8	of

0.3	0.4	years),
0.5	0.5	has

0.6	0.7	again
0.4	0.3	struck

1	0.6	In

0.4	0.4	been
0.4	0.4	something
0.3	0.3	more

0.1	1	and
0.9	0.3	penetrated

0.1	0.5	into
0.5	0	the

0	0.7	where
0.6	0.4	he

0.6	0.2	period
0.9	0.9	of
0.8	0.2	nearly
0.8	0.6	two

0.2	0.9	
0.4	0.2	Meanwhile,
0.3	0.1	the
0.3	0.9	whale
0.7	0.5	he

0.6	0.9	must

0.6	0.2	have

0.9	0.4	no

0.4	0.9	it

0.1	0.8	
0.9	0.3	This

0.4	0.7	and
0.8	0.4	this

0.8	0.9	I
0.9	0	say
0.2	0.3	I,
0.2	0.8	myself,
0.4	0.9	have
0.6	0.5	known
0.7	0.8	three
0.9	0.5	instances
0.5	0.1	similar
0.1	0.9	to
0.3	0.4	this;
0.6	0.6	that

0	0.3	in
0.6	0.8	two
0.7	0.6	of
0.4	0.1	them
0.4	1	I
0.6	0.9	saw
0.4	0.3	the

0.5	0.8	struck;
0.8	0.8	and,
0.6	0.5	upon

0.7	0.2	attack,
0.1	0	saw
1	0.8	the

0	0.8	
0.1	0.5	In
0.9	0.3	the
0.8	0.2	three-year
0.8	0.9	instance,
0.5	0.7	it
0.7	0.9	so

0.9	0.8	
0.1	0.9	Here
0.6	0.6	are
0.2	0.1	three
0.9	0	instances,
0.4	0.2	then,
0.2	0.4	which
0.5	0.6	I
0.4	0	personally
0.9	0.4	know
0.4	0.8	the

0.6	0.8	of;
0.9	0.4	but
0.7	0.8	I

0.2	0.6	
0.8	0.5	Secondly:
0.5	0.1	It

0.7	0.9	
0.3	0.6	No:

0.8	0.1	at

1	1	worse

0.5	1	a
0.4	0.1	hideous
0.4	0.9	and
0.8	0.7	intolerable
0.7	0.5	allegory.
0.3	0.3	
0.9	0.4	First:
1	0.2	Though
0.1	0.2	most
0.6	0.7	men
0.6	0.7	have
0.9	0.1	some
0.6	0.6	vague
0.4	0.3	flitting
0.5	0.4	ideas
0.3	0.3	of
0.6	1	the
0.6	0.8	general
0	0.9	perils
0.3	0.4	of
0.9	0.7	the

0.2	0.4	yet
0.6	0.5	they

0.8	0.9	nothing
0.8	0.7	like
0.4	0.1	a
0.1	0.5	fixed,
1	0.8	vivid
0.6	0.8	conception
0.1	0.1	of
0.4	0.5	those
0.3	0.4	perils,
0.3	0.3	and
0	0.4	the
1	0.5	frequency
0.9	0.8	with
0.8	0.2	which
0.9	1	they
0.5	0.4	recur.
0.1	0.5	
0.6	0.8	One
0.2	0.3	reason
0.4	1	perhaps
0.6	0.8	is,
0.3	0.7	that
0.6	0.8	not
0.8	0.9	one
0.5	0.2	in
0	0.4	fifty
0.4	1	of
0.4	0.6	the
0.8	0.9	actual
0.7	0.3	disasters
0.2	0.5	and
0	0.7	deaths
1	0.1	by
0.8	0.2	casualties
1	0.6	in
0	0.9	the

0	0.9	ever
0.6	0.4	finds
0.7	0.9	a

0.6	0.7	record
0.2	0.4	at
0.3	0.4	home,
0.3	0.9	however
1	0.8	transient
0.4	0.8	and
0.3	0.3	immediately
0.8	0.7	forgotten
0.7	1	that
0.3	0.5	record.
0.1	0.7	
0.5	0.1	Do
0.5	1	you
0.4	0.3	suppose
0.5	0.1	that
0.9	0.2	that
0.5	0.1	poor
0.5	1	fellow
0.5	0.2	there,
0.3	0.3	who
0.6	0.7	this
0.6	0.2	moment
0.2	0.1	perhaps
0.8	1	caught
0.9	0.2	by
0.9	0.9	the

0.3	0.2	off
0.8	1	the
0.1	1	coast
0.1	0.3	of
0.7	0.9	New
0.2	0.1	Guinea,
0.9	0.2	is

0.3	0.3	sea
1	0.3	by
0.6	0.6	the
0.6	0.3	sounding
1	0.8	leviathan--do
0.7	0.2	you
0.2	0.1	suppose
0.6	0.3	that
0.5	0.6	that
0.6	0.4	poor
0.2	0	fellow's
0.2	0.5	name
0.1	0.9	will
0.4	1	appear
0.2	0.2	in
0.7	0.2	the
0	0.1	newspaper
0.5	0.7	obituary
0.4	0.2	you
0.3	0.1	will
0.3	0.3	read
0.2	0.9	to-morrow
0.5	0.1	at
0.6	0.3	your
1	0.6	breakfast?
0.8	0.3	No:
0	0.7	because
0.3	0.2	the
0.5	0.8	mails
0.9	0.2	are
1	0.6	very
0.4	0.9	irregular
0.2	0.1	between
0.9	0.1	here
0.7	0.1	and
0.8	0	New
0.2	0.4	Guinea.
0.9	0.2	In
0	0.4	fact,
0.4	0.6	did
0.6	0.9	you
0.8	0.8	ever
0.1	0.1	hear
0.4	0.8	what

1	0.9	Guinea?
0.8	0.3	
0.5	0.8	Yet
0.3	0.8	I
0.8	0.4	tell
0.3	0.7	you
0.1	0.4	that
0.3	0.4	upon
0.3	0.9	one
0.6	0	particular
0.3	0.3	voyage
0.9	0.3	which
0.4	0.8	I
0.6	0.5	made
0.1	0.2	to
0.9	0.7	the
0.3	0.6	Pacific,
0.9	0	among
0.7	0.3	many
0.8	0.7	others
0.6	0.5	we
0.1	0.1	spoke
0.7	0.5	thirty
0.4	0.8	different
0.3	0.1	ships,
0.1	0.8	every
0.9	0.5	one
0.3	0.5	of
0.9	0.6	which
0.5	1	had
0.6	0.8	had
0.1	0.6	a
0.1	0.7	death
0.3	0.6	by
0.3	0.1	a
0.1	0.6	whale,
0.4	0.2	some
0.5	0	of
0.1	0.5	them
0.2	0.4	more
0.5	0.5	than
0.4	0.6	one,
0.6	0.3	and
0.5	0.3	three
0.3	0.5	that
0.8	0.2	had
0.7	0.8	each
0.8	0.9	lost
0.1	0.9	a
0.1	0.6	boat's
0.1	0.7	crew.
0.9	0.3	For
1	0.1	God's
0.9	0.7	sake,
0.9	0.6	be
0.5	0.2	economical
0.1	0.7	with
0.3	0.1	your
0.7	0.1	lamps
0.5	0.5	and
0.9	0.3	candles!
0.8	0.2	not
0.3	0.3	a
1	0.7	gallon
0.9	0.9	you
0.9	0.9	burn,
1	0.8	but
0.6	0	at
0.2	0.2	least
0.1	0.4	one
0.1	0.4	drop
0.9	0.1	of
0	0.4	man's
0.4	0.7	blood
0.1	0.4	was
0.9	0.4	spilled
0.7	0.2	for
0.3	0.9	it.
0.8	0.7	
0.3	0.8	Secondly:
0.6	0.3	People
0.8	0.1	ashore
0.3	0.9	have
0.3	0.4	indeed
0.1	0.3	some
0.6	1	indefinite
0.9	0.1	idea
0.7	0.1	that
0.6	0.8	a
0.4	0.4	whale
0.4	0.1	is
1	0.3	an
0.5	0.6	enormous
0.7	0.7	creature
1	0.3	of
0.9	0.4	enormous
0.1	0.9	power;
0.4	0	but
0.3	0.1	I
0	0.1	have
0.5	0	ever
0.7	0.4	found
0.7	0.4	that
0.1	0.3	when
0.5	1	narrating
0.5	0.7	to
0.5	0.2	them
0.5	0.2	some
0.2	0.3	specific
0	0.9	example
0.1	0.2	of
0.3	0.1	this
0.2	0.9	two-fold
0.1	1	enormousness,
0.2	0.5	they
0.1	0.3	have
0.9	0.2	significantly
0.1	0.9	complimented
0.7	1	me
0.8	0.2	upon
0.8	0.5	my
0.1	1	facetiousness;
0.5	0.1	when,
0.2	0.5	I
0.4	0.3	declare
0.6	1	upon
0.3	0.9	my
0.1	0.3	soul,
0.9	0.2	I

0.9	1	the

0.8	0.8	was
0.2	0.3	pleased
0.9	0.9	to
0.1	0.7	be
0.3	0.5	sceptical
0.9	0.5	touching
0.1	0.6	the
1	0.3	amazing
0.8	0.8	strength
0.5	0.3	ascribed
0.1	0.6	to
0.5	0.4	them
0.3	0.3	by
0.3	0.9	the
0.7	0.1	professional
0.8	0.2	gentlemen
0.5	0.9	present.
0.6	0.8	
0.4	0.4	He
0.8	0.4	peremptorily
0	0.7	denied
0.4	0.6	for
0.3	0.5	example,
0.1	0.5	that
0.7	0.3	any
1	0.3	whale
0.7	0.5	could
0.4	0.1	so
0.2	0.5	smite
1	0.3	his

0.4	0.9	as
0.7	0.1	to

0.3	0.1	her
0.1	0.1	to
0.5	0.8	leak
0.6	0.4	so
0.2	0.9	much
0.9	0.8	as
0.5	0.1	a
0.2	0.9	thimbleful.
0.8	0.8	
0.9	0.7	Very
0.3	0.7	good;
0.1	0.7	but
0.5	0.8	there
0.4	0.9	is
0.1	0.6	more
0	0.2	coming.
0.9	0.7	
0.4	0.1	Some
0.5	0.8	weeks
0.9	0.5	after,
0.5	0.2	the
0.5	0.3	Commodore
0.8	0.6	set
0.4	0.2	sail
0.1	0.6	in
0.8	0.8	this
0.7	0	impregnable
0.7	0.3	craft
0.2	0	for

0.4	0.7	
0.9	0.8	But
0.2	0.6	he
0.6	0.2	was
0.3	0.3	stopped
0.6	0.3	on
0.3	0.1	the

0.1	0	portly
0.2	0.7	sperm
0.9	0.6	whale,
0.8	0.1	that
0.1	0.3	begged
0.1	0.9	a
0.9	0.7	few
0.7	0.9	moments'
0.1	0.8	confidential
0.5	0.1	business
0.1	0.7	with
0.8	0	him.
0.2	0.7	
0.7	0	That
0.5	0.5	business
0.4	0.4	consisted
0.4	0.3	in
0.1	0.1	fetching
0.3	0.4	the

0.1	0.9	craft
0.7	0.6	such
0.1	1	a

1	0.5	all
0.4	0.8	his

0.7	0.7	going
0.8	0.8	he

1	0.9	I
0.2	0.8	am
0.2	0	not

0.4	0.3	instead

0.6	0.3	
0.7	0.5	I
0.9	0.4	have

0.8	0.5	I
0.5	0.9	have

0.6	0.2	
0.2	0.1	Soon

0.5	0.3	
0.4	0.2	You
0.1	0.6	may
1	0.1	think
0.7	0.2	with
0.1	0.2	what
0.8	0.6	emotions,
1	0.9	then,
0.3	0.8	the

0.4	0.7	
0.3	0.8	But

0.9	0.7	when,
0.4	0.1	after
0.1	1	all
0.5	0.9	this
0.1	0	silence,
0.3	0.3	his
0.9	0	unearthly
0.9	0.2	voice
0.4	0.3	was
0.6	0.2	heard
0.4	0.1	announcing
0	0.5	that
0.8	0.1	silvery,

0.5	0.3	jet,
0.6	0.4	every
0.6	0.4	reclining

0.8	0.3	started
0.8	0.6	to
0.1	0.4	his
0.2	0.4	feet
0.7	0.3	as
0.5	0.6	if
0	0.3	some
0.1	0.1	winged
0.9	0.6	spirit
1	0.9	had
0.5	0.6	lighted
0.7	0.3	in
0.3	0.4	the

1	0.3	and

0.1	0.3	
0.8	0.5	"There

0.3	0	yet
0.4	0.8	still
0.6	0.7	they
0.2	0	felt
0.4	0	no

0.9	0.6	rather
0.8	0.2	pleasure.
1	0.1	
0.8	0.1	For
0.3	0.5	though
0.7	0.9	it
0.5	0.9	was
0.6	0.1	a
0.4	1	most
0.3	1	unwonted
0.7	0.5	hour,
0	1	yet
0.5	0.2	so
0.6	0.8	impressive
0.9	0.6	was
0.8	0.9	the
0.3	1	cry,
0.3	0.2	and
0.3	0.1	so
0.8	0.2	deliriously
0.9	0.2	exciting,
0.2	0.5	that
1	0.2	almost
0.8	0.4	every
0.4	0.3	soul
0.3	0.4	on
0.1	0.3	board
0.9	0.9	instinctively
0.7	0.1	desired

0.9	0.2	
1	0.8	Walking
0.2	0.1	the

0.3	0.5	with
0.6	0.7	quick,
0.9	1	side-lunging

0.1	0.1	Ahab

0.8	0.4	and

0.6	0.2	to

1	0.9	
0.1	0.4	The

0	0.3	man
0.5	0.5	in
0.4	0.8	the

0.2	0.5	must
0.1	0.8	take
1	0.4	the

0.4	0.6	
0.4	0.9	Then,
0.9	0.6	with
1	0.3	every
0.5	0.5	mast-head
0.5	0.2	manned,
0.9	0.6	the
0.6	0	piled-up

0.6	0.4	rolled
0.5	0	down
0.4	0.7	before

0.9	0.8	
0.1	0.2	The

1	0.8	of

0.3	0.7	of

0.3	0.3	many
0.7	0.7	sails,
0.4	0.6	made
0.6	0.1	the
0.9	0.7	buoyant,
0.4	0.7	hovering

0	0.9	to
0.6	0.9	feel

0.8	0.4	beneath

0.1	0.1	while
0.9	0.4	still
0.7	0.2	she
0.4	0.8	rushed
0.1	0.1	along,
0.3	0.6	as
0.3	0.9	if
0.6	0.3	two
0.6	0.9	antagonistic
0.3	0.7	influences
0.6	0.1	were
0.6	1	struggling
0.4	0.6	in

0.2	0.3	goal.
0.7	0.8	
0.4	0.8	And
0.6	0.1	had
0.8	0.5	you
0.2	0.4	watched
0.4	0.6	Ahab's
0.4	0.7	face
0.3	0.9	that
0.3	0.8	night,
0.7	0.7	you
0.3	1	would
0.3	0.6	have

0.7	0.3	that
0	0.2	in

0.8	0.9	also
0.7	0.3	two
0.7	0.8	different
0.8	0.9	things
0.4	0.6	were
0.3	0.3	warring.
0.2	0.1	
0.5	0.3	While
0.7	0.4	his
0.2	0.2	one
0.1	0.3	live
0.7	0.2	leg
0.4	0.8	made
0.3	0.3	lively
0.1	0.6	echoes
0.1	0.9	along
0	0.7	the
0.6	0.3	deck,
0.8	0.3	every
0.4	0.7	stroke
0.1	0.6	of
1	0.8	his
0.3	1	dead
0.5	0.8	limb
0.6	0	sounded
0.5	0.8	like
0.2	0.4	a
0.5	0.6	coffin-tap.
0.9	0.3	
0	0.3	On
0.4	0.1	life
0.5	0.1	and

0.7	0.4	this

0.8	0.3	time.
1	0.4	
0.3	0.1	This
0.9	0.8	midnight-spout
0.8	0.4	had
0.8	0.9	almost
0.2	0.6	grown
0.8	0.4	a

0.1	0.5	thing,
0.9	0.2	when,
0.6	0.7	some

0.7	0.5	again
0.2	0.7	it
0.4	0.9	was

1	0	for
1	0.2	your

0.3	0.8	is

0.8	0.5	and
0.4	0.6	your

0.3	0.6	in
0.7	0.9	anybody
0.8	0.1	but
0.5	0.5	himself.
0.4	0.8	
0.4	0.9	Besides,
0.4	0	the
0.8	0.1	English
0.9	0.6	whalers
0.3	0.4	sometimes
0.2	0.5	affect
0.6	0.6	a
0.1	0.5	kind
0.5	0.6	of
0.3	0.7	metropolitan
0.7	0.1	superiority
0.8	0.8	over
0.5	0.3	the
0.2	0.6	American
0.6	0.3	whalers;
0.6	0.1	regarding
0.3	0.1	the
0.7	1	long,
0.4	1	lean
0.7	0.8	Nantucketer,
0.9	0.3	with
0.7	0.5	his
0.5	0.3	nondescript

0.3	0.5	as
0.6	0.4	a
0.7	1	sort
0.9	0.8	of
0.2	0.5	sea-peasant.
0.7	0.1	
0.8	1	But
1	0.6	where
0.8	0	this
0.7	0.8	superiority
0.8	0.1	in
1	0	the
0.1	0.6	English
0.9	0.9	whalemen
0.7	0.4	does
0.7	0.8	really
0.6	0.1	consist,
0.3	0.7	it
0.4	1	would
0.3	0.9	be
0.9	0.1	hard
0.1	0.8	to
0.6	0.1	say,
0.9	0.4	seeing
0.7	0.3	that
0.3	0.3	the
0.7	0.3	Yankees
0.5	0.6	in
0.2	0.2	one
0.6	0	day,
0.4	0.7	collectively,
1	0.9	kill
0.9	0.3	more
0.4	0.3	whales
0.2	0.1	than
0.9	0.8	all
1	0.8	the
0.8	0.8	English,
0.7	0.2	collectively,
0.8	0.1	in
0.2	1	ten
0.1	0.8	years.
0.2	0.2	
0.6	0.7	But
0.9	0.8	this
0.5	0.8	is
0.5	0.8	a
1	0.7	harmless
0.8	0.8	little
0.6	0.2	foible
0.1	0.2	in
0.9	0.5	the
0.4	0.6	English
0.1	0.6	whale-hunters,
0.4	0.3	which
0.6	0.3	the
0.8	0.3	Nantucketer
0.8	0.6	does
0.5	0.8	not
0.7	1	take
0.8	0.9	much
0.1	0.1	to
0.9	0.4	heart;
0.4	0.3	probably,
0.7	0.3	because
0.5	0.2	he
0.7	0.6	knows
0.3	0.8	that
0.7	0.9	he
0.6	0.2	has
0.6	0.6	a
0.4	0.6	few
0.5	0.7	foibles
1	0.8	himself.
0.1	0.3	
0.8	0.3	So,
0.9	0.2	then,
0.5	0.8	we
0.5	0.1	see
0.1	0.9	that
0.7	0.4	of
0.5	0.9	all
0.3	0.5	ships
0.2	0.8	separately
0.9	0.8	sailing
0.6	0.6	the
0.2	0.8	sea,
0.7	0.4	the
0.8	0.1	whalers
0.9	0	have
0.4	0.3	most
0.5	0	reason
0.6	1	to
0.5	0.6	be
0.3	0.3	sociable--and
0.5	0.6	they
0.5	0.6	are
0.4	0.1	so.
0.9	0.3	
0.8	0.1	Whereas,
0.2	1	some
0.8	0.6	merchant
0.4	0.9	ships
0.6	0.7	crossing

0.8	0.3	on
0.4	0.6	without
0.7	0.7	so
0.4	0.6	much
0.4	0.1	as
0.2	0.9	a
0.5	0.8	single
0.7	0.1	word
0.2	0.1	of

0.1	0.6	mutually
0.7	0.4	cutting
0.8	0.7	each

0.1	0.6	on
0.8	0.6	the

0.5	0.5	in

0.1	0.3	
0.2	0.5	As

0.8	0.6	when

0.6	0.9	they
0.7	0.9	first
0.8	0.3	go

0.1	0	a

0.7	0.1	such

0.8	0.4	that
0.1	0.3	there
0.4	0.6	does
0.3	0.2	not
0.6	0.9	seem
0	0.2	to

0.5	0.4	much
0.2	0.8	right-down
0.2	0.4	hearty
0.4	0.6	good-will

0.5	0.3	As
0.8	0	touching
0.5	0.8	Slave-ships
0.3	0.8	meeting,
0.4	0.4	why,
0.3	0.7	they

0.5	0.6	a
0.1	0.3	prodigious
0.1	0.7	hurry,
0.5	0.4	they

0.3	0.3	
0.5	0.2	And
0.3	0.2	as

0	0.9	
0.6	0.1	And
0.5	0.9	that

0.9	0.5	once

0.2	0.7	pirates
0.6	1	straightway
0.6	0.5	steer

1	0	for
0.8	0.7	they

0.1	0.6	
0.6	0.3	But
0.9	0.7	look
0.9	1	at
0.9	0.4	the
0.5	0.3	godly,
0.6	0.3	honest,
0.1	0.4	unostentatious,
0.1	0.9	hospitable,
0.5	0.9	sociable,
0.9	1	free-and-easy
0.7	0.5	whaler!
0.6	0.5	
0.8	0.3	What
0.7	0.8	does
0.5	0.6	the

0.4	0	do
0.6	0.9	when

0.2	0	in
0.9	0.4	any

0.1	0.6	of
0.6	0.6	decent

0.2	0.6	
0.4	0.1	She
0.4	0.9	has
0.6	0.7	a

0.6	0.4	a

0.5	0.5	so
0.1	0.8	utterly
0.1	0.4	unknown
0.3	0.4	to
0.7	0.8	all
0.1	0.3	other
0.4	0.6	ships
1	0.8	that
0.3	0.2	they
0.4	0.4	never
0.1	0.4	heard
0.4	0.3	of
0.6	0.8	the
0.9	0.7	name
0.5	0.8	even;
0.8	0.8	and
0.5	0.1	if
0.5	0.9	by
0.1	0.4	chance
0.4	0.8	they
0.3	0	should
0.2	0.1	hear
0.2	0.3	of
0.5	0	it,
0.2	0	they
0.6	0.5	only
0.4	0.3	grin
0.5	0.5	at
0.6	0.2	it,
0.6	0.4	and
0.1	0.7	repeat
0.1	0.4	gamesome
0	0.3	stuff
0.6	0.9	about
0.5	0.9	"spouters"
0.2	0.5	and
0.7	0.8	"blubber-boilers,"
0.7	0.2	and
0.5	0.6	such
0.1	0.8	like
0.6	0.8	pretty
0.8	0.4	exclamations.
0.8	0.1	
0.6	0.5	Why
0.4	0.9	it
0.8	0.2	is
0.2	1	that
0.8	0.5	all
0.6	0.8	Merchant-seamen,
0.5	0.2	and
0.7	0.5	also
0.3	0.6	all
0.1	0.8	Pirates
0.5	0.2	and
0.1	0.3	Man-of-War's
0.1	0.3	men,
0.7	0.8	and
0.7	0.1	Slave-ship
0.6	0.4	sailors,
1	0.7	cherish
0.4	0.2	such
0.3	0.7	a
0.7	0.4	scornful
0.8	0.9	feeling
0.8	1	towards
0.1	0.6	Whale-ships;
0.8	0.5	this
0.2	0.1	is
0.6	0.3	a
0.6	0.4	question
0.3	0.4	it
1	0.4	would
0.4	1	be
0.8	0.8	hard
0.1	0.1	to
0.2	0.7	answer.
0.2	0.7	
0.9	0.3	Because,
0.2	0.9	in
0.2	0.6	the
0.6	0.6	case
0.4	0.1	of
0.9	0.7	pirates,
0.9	0.6	say,
0.6	0.3	I
0.4	0.6	should
0.7	0.8	like
0	0.3	to
0.5	0.3	know
0.6	0.4	whether
0.1	0.4	that
0.2	0.4	profession
0.4	0	of
0.3	0.9	theirs
0.3	0.9	has
0.2	0.7	any
0.7	0.8	peculiar
0.6	0.7	glory
0.6	0.5	about
0.7	0.3	it.
0.1	0.5	
0.3	0.9	It
0.7	0	sometimes
0.2	0.8	ends
0.1	0.3	in
0.3	0.2	uncommon
0.2	0.6	elevation,
0.4	0.2	indeed;
0.4	0.2	but
0.5	0.4	only
0.1	0.9	at
0.3	0.1	the
0.6	0.8	gallows.
0.5	0.5	
0.2	0.6	And
0.1	0.3	besides,
0.1	0.3	when
0.3	0.4	a
0.9	0.3	man
0.4	0.2	is
0	0.7	elevated
0.9	0.6	in
0.6	0.9	that
0.5	0.3	odd
0	0.8	fashion,
0.6	0.7	he
0	0.8	has
0.4	0.4	no
0.3	0.3	proper
0.5	0.5	foundation
0.4	1	for
0.1	0.5	his
0	0.4	superior
0.9	0.5	altitude.
0	0.1	
0.5	0.6	Hence,
0.2	0.3	I
0.4	0.4	conclude,
0.6	0	that
0.6	1	in
1	0.6	boasting
0.2	0.8	himself
0.3	0.2	to
0.2	0.4	be
0.5	0.7	high
0.3	0.1	lifted
0.8	0.7	above
0.2	0.1	a
0.6	0.1	whaleman,
0.6	0.5	in
0	0.9	that
0.5	0.6	assertion
0.7	0.4	the
0.7	0.5	pirate
0.9	0.3	has
0.5	0.1	no
0.1	1	solid
0.6	0	basis
0.9	0.3	to
0.9	0.9	stand
0.2	0.5	on.
0.8	1	
0	0.1	But
0.8	0.6	what
0.6	1	is
0.5	0.8	a
0.5	0.9	GAM?
0.2	0.1	
0.8	0.6	You

0.3	0.6	
0.2	0.9	So

0.4	0.1	
0.9	0.5	After
0.3	0.8	the
0.4	0.8	full
0.7	0.4	interval
0.3	0.5	of
0.8	0.3	his
0.1	0.1	sounding
0.9	0.2	had
0.4	0.4	elapsed,
0.1	0.2	the

0.6	0.9	rose
0.2	0.8	again,

0.6	0.7	
0.6	0.7	It
0.9	0.7	was
0.1	0.8	obvious,
0.3	0.1	now,
0.3	0	that
0.3	0.8	the

0.8	0.6	All

0.5	0.8	of

0.8	0.6

0.1	0.5	
0.9	0.3	And

0.8	0.6	the

0.8	0.3	
0.3	0.9	I
0.1	0.3	have
1	0.2	had
0.2	0.6	controversies
0.9	0.5	about
0.1	0.7	it
0.6	0.9	with

0.7	0.6	whalemen

0.7	0.6	
0.8	0.8	My
1	0.4	original
0.4	0.9	opinion
0.7	0.4	remains
0.3	1	unchanged;
0.4	0.7	but
0.4	0.4	it
0.2	0.8	is
0.8	0.3	only
0.7	0.3	an
0.4	0.4	opinion.
0.3	0.5	
1	0.2	The
0.8	0.1	question
0.3	0.8	is,
0.2	0.3	what
0.5	0.9	and
0.2	0.4	where
0.1	0.3	is
0.7	0.6	the
0.4	0.7	skin
0	0.4	of
0.1	0.4	the
0.5	0.8	whale?
0.1	0.2	
0.6	0.1	Already
0.6	0.1	you
0.1	0	know
0.9	0.3	what
0.3	0.1	his
0.5	0.3	blubber
0.5	0.7	is.
0.9	0.3	
0.4	0.5	That
0.5	0.6	blubber
0.5	0.2	is
0.5	0.3	something
0.4	1	of
0.5	0.9	the
0.4	0.4	consistence
0.3	0.3	of
0.9	0.4	firm,
0.5	0.5	close-grained
0.5	0.1	beef,
0.7	0	but
0.3	0.8	tougher,
0	0.3	more
0.3	0.7	elastic
0.1	0.5	and
0.3	0.9	compact,
0.1	0.4	and
0	0.1	ranges
0.5	0.8	from
0.8	0.6	eight
0.6	0.1	or
1	0.6	ten
0.2	0.5	to

0.2	0.5	inches

0.6	0.8	
0.1	0.2	Now,
0.7	0.8	however
0.5	0.1	preposterous
0.7	0.5	it
0.8	0.2	may
0.5	0.5	at
0.3	0.5	first
0.8	0.3	seem
0.8	0.1	to

0.4	0.3	yet
0.6	0.3	in

0.6	0.9	of

1	0.6	these

0.5	0.1	against
0.1	0.5	such
0.7	0.1	a

0.4	0.7	True,

0.1	0.2	
0.9	0	I
0.1	0.9	have

0.1	0.8	
0.7	0.9	It

0.5	0.9	
0.8	0.7	At
0.4	0.1	any
0.4	0.9	rate,
1	0.1	it
0.4	0	is
0.9	0.2	pleasant
0.6	0.7	to

0.7	0.5

0.7	0.1	of
0.7	0.5	the

0.6	0.9	for

0.5	0.6	were
0.5	0.2	simply
0	0.9	ridiculous
0	0.2	to

0.7	0.3	sacredness.
1	0.4	
0.7	0.4	Moreover,
0	0.3	they
0.9	0.7	were
0.8	0.3	afraid
0.3	0	of

0.5	0	
0.1	0.1	As
0.9	0.4	such
0.1	0.1	a
0.7	0	man,
0.9	0.7	however,
0.9	0.3	was
0.3	0.1	not

0.7	0.7	practical
0.2	0.1	use
0.3	0.5	in
0	0.9	the
0.6	0.2	ship,
0.9	0.6	especially
0.5	1	as
0.3	0.7	he
0.1	0.3	refused

1	0.3	work
0.5	0.3	except
0.4	0.6	when
0.4	0.8	he
1	0.2	pleased,
0.4	0.6	the
0.1	0.3	incredulous
0.4	0.4	captain
0.7	0.9	would
0.3	0.7	fain
0.1	0.4	have
0.2	0.5	been
0.6	0.3	rid
0.9	0.7	of
0.2	0.2	him;
0.4	0	but
0.5	0.1	apprised
0.3	0.3	that
0.2	0.2	that
0.7	0.5	individual's
0.8	0.7	intention
0.9	0.9	was
0.2	0.1	to
0.7	0.7	land
0.2	0.4	him
0.1	0.8	in
0.4	1	the
0.3	0.3	first
0.1	0.3	convenient
0.6	0.1	port,
0.9	0.6	the
0.2	0.6	archangel
0.5	0.1	forthwith
0.5	0.5	opened
0.5	0.1	all
0.5	0.9	his
0.4	0.1	seals
0.5	0.3	and
0.4	1	vials--devoting
0.1	0.3	the
0.8	0.6	ship
0.1	0.6	and
0.7	0.9	all
0.8	0.9	hands
0.3	0.6	to
0.4	0.5	unconditional
0.1	0.3	perdition,
0.9	0.9	in
0.8	0.1	case
0.6	0.6	this
0.1	0.6	intention
1	0.3	was
0.5	0.8	carried
0.5	0.6	out.
0.6	0.5	
0.7	0.9	So
0.8	0.3	strongly
0.9	0.6	did
0.9	0.7	he
0.1	0.6	work
0.8	0.9	upon
0.2	0.5	his
1	0.4	disciples
0.8	0.5	among
0.8	0.6	the
0.1	0.8	crew,
0.6	0.3	that
0.5	0.1	at
0.9	0.4	last
0.9	0.1	in
0.6	0.7	a
0.3	0.5	body
0.8	0.8	they
0.4	0.8	went
0.4	0.8	to
0.6	0.2	the
0.8	0.6	captain
0.6	0.9	and
0.4	0.2	told
0	0.4	him
0.9	0.8	if
0.4	0.4	Gabriel
0.8	0.8	was
0.5	0.7	sent
0.3	0.6	from

0.2	0.3	of
0.9	0.7	them
0.3	0.5	would
0.7	0.7	remain.
1	0.7	
0.5	0.8	He
0.2	0.8	was
0.9	0.9	therefore
0.4	0.8	forced
0.6	0.5	to
0.2	1	relinquish
0.1	0.8	his
0.9	0.3	plan.
0.8	0	
0.7	0.3	Nor
0.3	0.7	would
0.2	0.8	they
0.8	0.8	permit
0.2	0.8	Gabriel
0	0.9	to
0.2	0.3	be
0.9	0.3	any
0.5	0.6	way
0.8	0.6	maltreated,
0.8	0.9	say
0	1	or
0.5	0.2	do
0.7	0.2	what
0.8	0.4	he
0.8	0.4	would;
0.1	0.8	so
0.8	0.4	that
0.3	0.9	it
0.1	0.5	came
0.3	0	to
0.6	0.1	pass
0.8	0.2	that
0.1	0.1	Gabriel
0.3	0	had
1	0.1	the
0.7	0.7	complete
0.9	0.5	freedom
0	0.7	of
0.9	0.8	the
0.1	0.6	ship.
0.9	0.3	
0.3	0.9	The
0.2	0.9	consequence
0.7	0.1	of
0.1	0.3	all
0.2	0.6	this
0.5	0.3	was,
0.5	0.7	that
0	0	the
0.8	0.7	archangel
0.9	0.8	cared
0.1	0.7	little
0.2	0.5	or
0.7	0.9	nothing
0.8	0.2	for
0.7	0.4	the
0.9	0.1	captain
0.5	0.2	and
0.1	0.8	mates;
0.1	0.5	and
0.5	0.5	since
0.6	0.8	the
0.6	1	epidemic
0.9	0.3	had
1	0.9	broken
0.4	1	out,
0.4	0.6	he
0.7	0.9	carried
0.4	0.8	a
0.5	0.3	higher
0.2	0.1	hand
0.4	0.3	than
0.5	1	ever;
0.5	0.6	declaring
0.5	0.7	that
0.9	0.6	the
0.6	0.3	plague,
0.1	0.8	as
0.2	0.3	he
0.4	0	called
0.8	0.1	it,
0.6	0.4	was
0.7	0.9	at
0.1	0.8	his
0.6	0.4	sole
0.5	0.8	command;
0.3	0.7	nor
0	0.7	should
0.5	0.3	it
0.8	0.5	be
0.2	0.8	stayed
0.9	0.9	but
0.8	0.1	according
0.4	0.7	to
0.8	0.3	his
0.5	1	good
0.5	0.1	pleasure.
0.3	0.6	
0.5	0.6	The
0.5	0.8	sailors,
0.4	0.4	mostly
0.3	0.5	poor
0.6	0.2	devils,
0.6	0.5	cringed,
0	0.5	and
0.6	0.8	some
0.7	0.7	of
0.7	0.7	them
0.4	0.3	fawned
0.8	0.6	before
0.3	0.4	him;
0.4	0.2	in
0.7	0.7	obedience
0.8	0.8	to
0	0.2	his
0.2	0.2	instructions,
0.5	0.6	sometimes
0.4	0.8	rendering
0.7	0.6	him
0.3	0.3	personal
0.8	0.3	homage,
0.8	0.2	as
0.7	1	to
0.6	0.3	a
0.5	0.6	god.
0.8	0.2	Such
0.8	0.3	things
0.2	0	may
0.2	0.1	seem
0.2	0.3	incredible;
0	0.5	but,
0.4	0.5	however
0.3	0.2	wondrous,
0.8	0.8	they
0.9	0.1	are
0.1	0.1	true.
1	0.3	
0.9	0.5	Nor
1	0.4	is
0.4	0.8	the
0.9	0.3	history
0.8	0.6	of
0.1	0.2	fanatics
0.1	0.3	half
0.2	0.3	so
0.4	0.7	striking
0.9	0	in
0.5	0.7	respect
0.8	0.4	to
0.1	0.9	the
0.5	0.6	measureless
0.3	0.5	self-deception
0.2	0.1	of
0.3	0.6	the
0	0.7	fanatic
0.5	0.2	himself,
0.2	0.7	as
0.9	0.9	his
0.9	0	measureless
0.5	0	power
0.7	0.7	of
0.2	1	deceiving
0.6	0.3	and
0.3	0.1	bedevilling
0	0.5	so
0.5	0.6	many
0.1	0.5	others.
0.5	0.9	
0.7	0.7	But
0.5	0.1	it
0.7	0.5	is
0.6	0.9	time
0.1	0.4	to
0.6	0.1	return
0.7	0.2	to
0.1	0.6	the
0.6	0.8	Pequod.
1	0.4	
0.8	1	"I
0.9	0.5	fear
0.4	0	not
0.7	0.8	thy
0.9	0.3	epidemic,
0.1	0.6	man,"
1	0.8	said
0.8	0.7	Ahab
0.4	0.8	from
0.3	0.6	the
0.3	0.2	bulwarks,
0.6	0.9	to
0.8	0.3	Captain
0.9	0.7	Mayhew,
0.3	0	who
0.3	0.3	stood
0.4	0.5	in
0.9	0.6	the
0.1	0.3	boat's
0.3	0.7	stern;
0.7	0.2	"come
0	0.7	on
0.8	0.4	board."
0.1	0.4	
0.3	0.2	But
0	1	now
0.1	0.6	Gabriel
0.1	0.5	started
0.8	0.5	to
0.8	0.9	his
0.6	0.8	feet.
0.3	0.6	
0.3	0.3	"Think,
0.5	0	think
0.9	0.9	of
0.3	0.9	the
0.9	0.8	fevers,

0.9	0.3	bilious!
0.3	0.7	
0.7	0.1	Beware

0.6	0.6	
0.3	0.7	"Gabriel!

0.9	0.9	instant
0.7	0.5	a
0.8	1	headlong
0	0.6	wave
0.2	0.3	shot
0.5	0.9	the

0	0.3	ahead,
0.5	0.9	and
0.9	1	its

1	0.1	
0	0.8	"Hast

0.8	0.8	demanded
0.9	0.2	Ahab,
0.9	0.5	when
0.8	0.6	the
0.5	0.1	boat
0.8	0.9	drifted
0	0.1	back.
0.6	0.4	
0.8	0.4	"Think,

0.3	0.8	
0.2	0.6	But
0.3	0.9	again
0.7	0.3	the

0.3	1	tore

0.7	0.6	as

0.3	0.5	
0.3	0.4	Nothing

0.5	0.6	said
0.4	0.1	for
0.1	0.8	some

0.5	0.2	a
0.1	0.9	succession
0.8	0.9	of
0.4	0.9	riotous
0.5	0.5	waves
0.3	0.1	rolled
0.8	0.6	by,
0.8	0.8	which
0.8	0.6	by
0.8	0.5	one

0.1	0.5	caprices

0.3	0.2	Meantime,

0.7	0.4	sperm
0.8	0.1	whale's
0.1	0.7	head
0.5	0.9	jogged
0.5	0.2	about
0.7	0.5	very
0.2	0.8	violently,
0.8	0.6	and
1	1	Gabriel
0.8	0.7	was
0.4	0.9	seen
0.6	0.5	eyeing
0.6	0.2	it
0.9	0.8	with
0.1	0.3	rather

0.6	0.2	warrant.
0.9	0.2	
0.3	0.9	When
1	0.1	this
0.2	0.3	interlude
0.5	0	was
0.3	0.1	over,
0.4	0.2	Captain
0.4	0.9	Mayhew
1	0.1	began
0.6	0.6	a
0.1	0.6	dark
0.9	0.4	story

0.5	0.9	Gabriel,
0.6	0.2	whenever
0.4	0	his
0.3	1	name

0.3	0.1	
0.4	0.2	It
0.6	0.5	seemed
0.4	1	that
0.7	0.6	the
0.9	0.2	Jeroboam
0.7	0	had
0.8	0.3	not
0.4	0.4	long
1	0.8	left

0.7	0.5	upon

0.8	1	a
0.1	0.7	whale-ship,
0.8	0.5	her
0.4	0.4	people
0.6	0.8	were
0.5	0.7	reliably
0.8	0.6	apprised

0.9	0.3	Greedily

0.8	0.2	this
0.1	0.8	intelligence,
0.4	0.6	Gabriel
0.2	0.6	solemnly

0.9	0.1	in
0.5	0.3	his
0.9	0.9	gibbering
0.4	0.5	insanity,
0.6	0.6	pronouncing
0.5	0.6	the

0.8	0.8	to

0.9	0.4	no

0.4	0.6	But
0.6	0.3	when,
0.8	0.2	some

0.5	0.3	or
0.2	0.6	two
0.3	0.2	afterwards,
0.9	0.5	Moby

0.1	0.3	fairly
0.1	0.2	sighted

0.7	0.8	Macey,
0.8	0.5	the
0.1	0.9	chief
0.5	0.9	mate,
0.1	0.9	burned
0.3	0.5	with
0.7	0.7	ardour
0.2	1	to

0.2	0.8	him;
0.8	0.6	and
0.3	0.3	the
0.3	0.9	captain
0.5	0.7	himself
0.9	0.6	being
0.8	0.4	not

0.9	0.5	despite
0.3	0.5	all
0.7	0.3	the

0.2	0.5	denunciations
0.2	0.2	and

0.2	0.9	Macey
0.8	0.1	succeeded

0.8	0.6	his

0.2	0.7	With
0.5	0.4	them
0.7	0.6	he
0.8	0.3	pushed
0.4	0.4	off;
1	0.1	and,
0.1	0.1	after
0.1	0.6	much
0.1	0.3	weary
0.4	0.8	pulling,

0.2	0.5	
0.3	0.4	Straightway,

0.1	0.7	and
0.5	0.4	taking
0.1	0.5	the
0.8	0.2	fatal
0.9	0.2	missive
0.8	0.3	from
1	0.7	Starbuck's

0.8	0.7	he

0.5	0.7	of
0.7	0.2	the

0.1	0.2	
0.6	0.2	But
0.7	0.4	as

0.9	0.5	so,
0.5	0.4	the

0.8	0.8	expectantly
0.8	0.7	desisted

0.7	0.9	the

0.9	0.4	drifted

0.8	0.1	
0.8	0.9	Then

0.3	0.8	On

0.6	0.2	and
0.6	0.2	no

0.9	0.7	
0	0.7	Being

0.2	0.1	that

0.8	0.8	(the

0.6	0.1	one
0.6	1	from

0.6	0.5	it
0.3	0.3	was
0.2	0.7	my

0.1	0.2	duty
0.2	0.1	to

0.4	0.6	
0.7	0.8	You

0.7	0	
0.7	0.6	Just
0.5	0.2	so,
0.2	0.6	from
0.1	0.6	the
0.3	0.7	ship's
0.4	0	steep
0.3	0.3	side,
0.5	0.5	did
0.3	0.2	I
0.1	0.4	hold
1	1	Queequeg
0.9	0.1	down
0.3	0.9	there
0.8	0.5	in
0.5	0.3	the
0.9	0.5	sea,
0.4	0.5	by
0.9	0.8	what
0.8	0.5	is
0.7	0.2	technically
0.6	0.5	called
0.5	0.9	in
0.6	0.5	the
0.1	0.9	fishery
0.4	0.7	a

0.2	0	attached

0.2	0.6	strip
0.9	0.7	of
1	0.9	canvas
0.6	0.8	belted
0.2	0.3	round
0.7	0.3	his
0.6	0.8	waist.
0.5	1	
0.6	0.3	It
0.8	0.5	was
0.4	0.7	a
0.7	1	humorously
0	0.9	perilous
0.6	0.6	business
0	0.7	for
0.7	0.9	both
0.4	0.7	of
0.3	0.3	us.
0.4	0.3	
0.6	0.5	For,
0.2	0.5	before
0.7	0.9	we
0.8	0.7	proceed
0.2	0.7	further,
0.2	0.2	it
0.8	0.5	must
0.2	0.3	be
0.8	0.3	said
0.7	0.3	that
0	0.8	the
0.1	0.4	monkey-rope
1	0.3	was
0.8	0.5	fast
0.5	0.2	at
0.3	0.8	both
0	0.8	ends;
0.2	0.6	fast
0.5	0.3	to
0.8	0.6	Queequeg's
0.2	0.5	broad
0.4	0.9	canvas
0.6	0.5	belt,
0.8	0	and
0.9	0.5	fast
0.5	0.2	to
0.1	0.1	my
0.4	0.6	narrow
0.7	0.2	leather
0.6	0.2	one.
0.6	0.1	
0.7	0	So
0.9	1	that
0.2	0.5	for
0.7	0.9	better
0.4	0.8	or
0.4	0.5	for
0.4	0.9	worse,
0.4	0.3	we
0.2	0.5	two,
0.6	0.3	for
1	0.8	the
1	1	time,
0	0.2	were
0	0.5	wedded;
0.8	0.1	and
0.6	0.2	should
0	0.2	poor
0.2	0.5	Queequeg
0.1	0.2	sink
0.5	1	to
0.1	0.1	rise
0.2	0.8	no
0.6	0.1	more,
0.2	0.4	then
0.9	0.4	both
0.8	0.6	usage
0.7	0.3	and
0.9	0.8	honour
0.3	0.8	demanded,
1	1	that
0.3	0.2	instead
0.2	0.9	of
0.5	0.3	cutting
0.5	0.2	the
0.3	0.5	cord,
0.8	0.8	it
0.5	0.9	should
0.3	0.2	drag
0.2	0.2	me
0.6	0.7	down
0.2	1	in
0.7	0.9	his
0.8	0.6	wake.
0.2	0.7	
0.6	0.3	So,
0.2	0.8	then,
0.6	0.9	an
0.1	0.8	elongated
0.1	0.2	Siamese
0.2	0.5	ligature
0.1	0.8	united
0.5	0	us.
0.8	0.4	
1	0.5	Queequeg
1	0.5	was
1	0.7	my
0.2	0.8	own
0.8	0.9	inseparable
0.3	0.1	twin
0.8	0.6	brother;
0.3	0.2	nor
0.5	0.1	could
0.4	0.7	I
0.8	0.9	any
0.9	0.8	way
0.1	0.9	get
0.7	0.1	rid
0.9	0.6	of
0.4	0.9	the
0	0.3	dangerous
0.3	0.6	liabilities
0.3	0.9	which
0.3	0.4	the
0.3	0.8	hempen
0.9	0	bond
0.1	0.7	entailed.
0.1	1	
0.4	0.1	So
0.7	0.3	strongly
0.9	0.5	and
1	0.1	metaphysically
0.3	0.9	did
0.4	1	I
0.4	0.8	conceive
0.1	0.8	of
0.9	0.9	my
0.2	0.6	situation
0.2	0.7	then,
0.6	0	that
0.4	0.6	while
0.3	0.3	earnestly
0.3	0.7	watching
0.3	0.2	his
0.1	0.6	motions,
0.5	0.3	I
0.6	0.1	seemed
0.4	0.7	distinctly
1	0.2	to
0.7	0.4	perceive
0.1	0.1	that
0.9	0.8	my
0.8	0.5	own
0.1	0.5	individuality
0.4	0.5	was

0.2	0.3	
0.4	0.1	Therefore,
0.7	0.8	I
0.6	0.1	saw
0.7	0.8	that
0.8	0.7	here

0.9	0.7	
0.1	0.1	And
0.2	0	yet
0.3	0.6	still
0.5	0.6	further
0.4	0.7	pondering--while

0.3	0.8	him--still
0.3	0.5	further
0.1	0.9	pondering,
0	0.7	I
0.3	0	say,
0.2	0	I
1	0.3	saw
0.1	0.3	that
0.2	0.1	this
0.7	0.2	situation
0.4	0.7	of

0.5	0	was

0.9	0.4	
0.9	0.8	True,
0.7	0.8	you
0.1	0.2	may

0.7	0.2	the

0.3	0.1	a

0.7	0.6	
0.6	0.4	Nor

0.7	0.8	wanting.
0.8	0.4	
0.7	0.9	Tall
0.1	0.2	spouts

0.4	0.7	and
0.1	0.6	two

0.2	0.6	were
0.7	0.7	detached

0.5	0.1	
0.1	0.5	Pulling
0.4	0.7	further

1	0.9	away,
0.4	0.6	they
0.3	0.7	at

0.1	0.6	at

0.1	0.8	
0.5	0.8	But
0.1	0.1	suddenly
0.5	0.2	in
0.5	0.1	the
0.7	0.7	distance,
0.7	0.6	they
0.8	0.8	saw
0.5	0.5	a

0.5	0.5	and
0.8	0.9	soon
0.8	0.8	after
0.4	0.8	news
0.9	0.4	came
0.6	0.6	from

0.1	0.5	or
0.4	0.5	both
0.1	0.2	the

0.1	0.1	must
1	1	be
0.4	0.8	fast.
0.2	0.2	
0.3	0.7	An
0.8	0.7	interval
0.8	0.3	passed
0.2	0.8	and
0.3	0.1	the
0.3	0.4	boats
0.8	0.9	were
0.3	0	in
0.9	0.5	plain

0.8	0.3	
0.7	0.3	So
0.2	0.5	close
0.9	0.6	did
0.1	0.3	the
0.8	0.3	monster
0.6	0.1	come
0.3	0.1	to
0.8	0.1	the

0.6	0.7	that
0.1	0.6	at
0	0.3	first
0.9	0.7	it

1	0.4	it
0.1	0.8	malice;

0.9	0.8	diving
0.7	0.8	under

0.8	0.9	
0.1	0.5	"Cut,
0.9	0.7	cut!"
0.3	0.7	was
0.3	0.2	the

0.8	0.8	from
0.5	0.5	the

0.2	0.1	to

0.8	0.6	boats,
0.3	1	which,
0.4	0.5	for
0.7	0.7	one
0.1	0.7	instant,
0.4	0.3	seemed
0.5	0.6	on
0.7	0.4	the

0.7	0.5	
0.8	0.1	But
0.2	0.4	having

0	0.1	For

0.3	0.3	few
0.7	0.3	minutes
0.2	1	the
0.6	0.1	struggle
0.5	0.1	was
0.6	0.8	intensely

0.6	0.4	
0.4	0.9	But
0.8	0.7	it

0.1	0.1	till
0.5	0.3	they

0.3	0.2	
0.3	0.5	A
0.2	0.5	curious
0.1	0.2	and
0.1	0	most
0.8	0.9	puzzling
0.6	0.8	question
0.7	0.9	might
0.9	1	be
0.8	0.3	started
0.8	0.9	concerning
0.1	0.4	this

0.8	0.7	matter
0.4	0.9	as
0.3	0.5	touching
0.1	0.1	the

0.8	0.6	
0.3	0	But
0.2	0.9	I
1	0.5	must
0.6	0.4	be
0.6	0.4	content
0.2	0	with
0.6	0.3	a

0.3	0.3	
0.7	0.6	So
0.7	1	long
0	0.3	as
0.6	0.2	a

0.9	0.8	eyes
0.3	0.6	are

0.3	0.3	involuntary;
0.5	0.1	that
0.3	0.2	is,
0.8	0.1	he

0.8	0.2	
0.1	0.5	Nevertheless,
0.4	0.1	any
1	0.1	one's
0.6	0.4	experience
0.3	0.8	will
0.5	0.7	teach
0.9	0	him,
0.3	0.2	that

0.3	0.5	of

0.3	0.8	at
0.7	0.1	one
0.3	0.5	glance,
0.5	0.5	it
0.6	0	is
0.1	0.1	quite
0.1	0	impossible
0.1	0.8	for
0.3	0.6	him,
0.6	0.8	attentively,
0.4	0.3	and
0.9	0.5	completely,

0.5	0.7	But
0.3	0.7	if

0.4	0.2	it,
0.8	0.5	the

0.9	0.3	
0.5	0.8	How
0.8	0.1	is
0.6	0.1	it,
0.7	0.6	then,
0.7	0.3	with
0.8	0.1	the
0.2	0	whale?
0.6	0.3	
0.3	0.9	True,
0.2	0.8	both
0.1	0.8	his

0.9	0.1	so
0.9	0.3	much
0.8	0.1	more

0.2	0.2	than
0.7	0.1	man's,
0.9	1	that
0.1	1	he

0.2	0.8	
0.4	0.8	If
0.2	0.9	he
0.3	0.9	can,
0.1	0.1	then
0.6	1	is
0.8	0.4	it
0.9	0	as
0.5	0.9	marvellous
0.1	0.7	a
0.1	0.7	thing
0.6	1	in
0.4	0.8	him,
0.9	0.7	as
0.3	0.5	if
0.3	0.9	a
0.3	0.8	man
0.4	0.1	were
0.5	0.7	able
0.1	0.2	simultaneously
0.5	0.6	to
0.8	0.1	go
0.1	0.3	through
0.7	0.1	the
0.1	0.4	demonstrations
0.9	0.4	of
0.2	0.7	two
0.1	0.8	distinct
0.8	0.8	problems
0.9	0.3	in
0.3	0.3	Euclid.
0.6	0.8	
1	0.3	Nor,
0.2	0.4	strictly
0.8	0.3	investigated,
0.4	0.8	is
0.9	0.8	there
0.1	0.5	any
0.1	0.7	incongruity
0.6	0.9	in
0.5	1	this
0.7	0.1	comparison.
0.6	0.8	
0.3	0.6	It
0.8	0.7	may
1	0.8	be
0.2	0.3	but
0.6	1	an
0.2	0.6	idle
0.9	0.8	whim,
0.8	0.1	but
0.3	0.8	it
0.2	0.8	has
0.2	0	always
0.7	0.8	seemed
0.1	0.8	to
0.8	0.6	me,
0.7	0.3	that
0.9	0.9	the
0.4	0.1	extraordinary
0.5	0.8	vacillations
0.8	0.1	of
0.1	0.8	movement
0.8	1	displayed
0.3	0.3	by
0.8	0.4	some
0.2	0.3	whales
0.2	0.5	when
0.4	0.4	beset
0.6	0.3	by
0.9	0.5	three
0.8	0.7	or
1	0.4	four
0.5	0.5	boats;
0.3	0.6	the

1	0.3	and
0.9	0.5	liability
0.9	0.5	to
0.4	0.6	queer

0.2	0.7	so
0.7	0.1	common
0.8	0.6	to
0.1	0.7	such
0.7	0.4	whales;
0.8	0.9	I
0.9	0.9	think
0.7	1	that
0.6	0.8	all
0.9	0.8	this
0.3	0.6	indirectly
0.8	0	proceeds
0.6	0	from
0.6	1	the
0.6	0.7	helpless
0.1	0.7	perplexity
0.6	0.5	of
0.6	0.3	volition,
0.6	0.8	in
0.5	0.6	which
0.7	0.5	their
0.3	0.7	divided
0.4	0.3	and
0.5	0.9	diametrically
0.5	1	opposite
0.3	0.3	powers
0.3	0.8	of
0.3	0.2	vision
0.2	0.4	must
0.2	0.4	involve
0.1	0.4	them.
0.1	0.9	
0.6	0	But
0.9	0.8	the
0.2	0.2	ear
0.1	0.7	of
0.5	0.2	the
0.1	0.8	whale
1	0.5	is
1	0.6	full
0.4	0.6	as
0.1	0.5	curious
0.5	0.1	as
0.8	0.7	the
0.5	0.2	eye.
0.2	0.3	
0.2	0.2	If
0.8	0.9	you
0.8	0.3	are
0.7	0.7	an
0.1	0.6	entire
0	0.4	stranger
0.8	1	to
0.2	0.6	their
0.8	0.6	race,
0.7	0.3	you
0.5	0.1	might
0.9	0.9	hunt
0.7	0.1	over
0.3	0.6	these
0.2	0	two
0.2	0.9	heads
1	0.1	for
0.8	1	hours,
0.8	0.9	and
0.8	0.1	never
0.6	0.8	discover
0.5	0.8	that
0.8	0.7	organ.
0.8	0.8	
0.2	0.7	The
0.9	0.7	ear
0.5	0.7	has
0.6	0.5	no
0.4	0.9	external
0.1	0	leaf
0.7	0.4	whatever;
1	1	and
0	0.5	into
0.8	0.5	the
0.1	0.3	hole
0.1	0.6	itself
0.9	0.8	you
0.5	0.9	can
0.6	0.1	hardly
0.8	0.8	insert
0.2	0.8	a
0.1	0.1	quill,
0.4	0.3	so
0.9	0.4	wondrously
0.6	0.8	minute
0.5	0.2	is
0.1	0.9	it.
0.7	0.4	
0.1	0.4	It
0.9	0.5	is
0.7	0.7	lodged
0.2	0.9	a

0.4	0.4	behind
0.3	0.5	the

0.4	0	
0.2	0.8	With
0.6	0	respect
0.1	0.7	to
0.4	0.9	their

0.5	0.4	this
0.4	0.5	important
0.3	0.5	difference
0.4	0.1	is

0.2	0.9	
1	0.4	While
0.9	0.2	the
0.9	0.5	ear
0.6	0.5	of
0.9	0.4	the

0.8	0.2	
0.9	0.8	Is
0.9	0.7	it
0.1	0.2	not
0.7	0.6	curious,
0.4	1	that
0	0.8	so

0.5	0.1	Not

0.2	0.7	levers

0.9	0.2	the

0.3	0.9	of
0.4	0.5	what
0.4	0.6	I
0.3	0.6	started
0.5	0.8	with--that
0.7	0.8	the

0.6	0.8	Whale
0.2	0.9	and
0.6	0.1	the
0.9	0.1	Right

0.1	0.5	have
0.2	0.7	almost
0.1	0.7	entirely
0.8	0.3	different

0.7	0.9	
0.8	0.5	To
0.5	0.4	sum
1	0.3	up,
0.8	0.5	then:
0.9	0.7	in
0.2	0.5	the
0.9	0.3	Right
0.3	0.3	Whale's
0.1	0.7	there
0.7	0.2	is
0.3	0.3	no

0.9	0.3	no

0.1	0	no

0.3	0	
0.5	0.9	Nor

0.9	0.6	
0	0.8	Again,
0.1	0.9	the

1	0.1	Whale
0.7	0.3	has
0.7	0.3	two

0	0.1	for

0.7	0	
0.1	0.1	Can

0.5	0.3	
0.8	0.2	It

0.1	0.2	
0.3	0.2	I

0.4	0.7	Finally,

1	0.8	
0.4	0.3	Some

0.2	0.4	from

0.1	0.3	soon
0.3	0.9	after,
0.5	0.1	Queequeg
0.8	0.2	was

0.3	0.1	
0	0.6	Drawn
1	0.8	into

0.8	0.7	they

0.8	0.3	brought

0.3	0.7	but
0.5	0.1	Tashtego
0.1	0.9	was

0.3	0.4	
0.5	0.4	Now,
0.9	0.1	how

0.3	0.1	this

0.4	0.4	been
0.2	0.7	accomplished?
0.4	0.6	
0.9	0.3	Why,
0.8	0.3	diving
0.5	0.5	after
0.1	0.4	the

1	0.2	Queequeg
0.7	0.9	with

0.7	0.4	side
0.9	0.8	lunges
0.8	0.6	near

0.8	0.5	so
0.1	0.5	as
0.5	0	to
0.4	0.8	scuttle
0.5	0.7	a

0.5	0.8	hole
0.3	0.2	there;
0.3	0.1	then
0.9	0.7	dropping
0.6	0.6	his
0.1	0.5	sword,
0.2	0.6	had
0.8	0.6	thrust
0.4	0.2	his

0.1	0.6	far
0.7	1	inwards
0.3	0.4	and
0.6	0.3	upwards,
0.5	0.6	and
0.2	0.6	so

0.7	0.6	poor

0.9	0.9	
0.6	0.2	He
0.6	0.3	averred,
0.7	0.9	that
0.4	0.8	upon
0.8	0.2	first
0.8	0.5	thrusting

0	0.9	a

0.1	0	but
0.2	0	well
0.4	0.8	knowing
0.1	0.8	that
0.3	0.7	that

0.3	0.4	it
0.8	0.1	ought
0.1	0.4	to
0.2	0.1	be,
0.7	0.3	and
0.3	0.9	might
0	0.8	occasion
0.2	0.2	great
0.9	1	trouble;--he
0.8	0.3	had
0.3	0.3	thrust
0.7	0.7	back
0.1	0.4	the
0.6	0.5	leg,
0.5	0.4	and
0.6	0.8	by
0.3	0.3	a
0.4	0.4	dexterous
0.7	0.3	heave
0.6	0.1	and
0.9	0.7	toss,
0.7	0.4	had
0.9	0.8	wrought
1	0	a
0.3	0.1	somerset
0.7	0.8	upon
0.1	0.8	the
0.5	0.7	Indian;
0.2	0.2	so
0.7	0.1	that
1	0.4	with
0.8	0.9	the
0.1	0.3	next
0.3	0.3	trial,
0.6	0.1	he
0	0	came
1	0.5	forth
0.2	0.9	in
0.7	0.3	the

0.9	0.6	old
0.8	0.4	way--head
0.8	0.3	foremost.
0.8	0.8	
0.1	0.8	As
0.5	0.9	for
0.8	0.3	the

0.2	0.3	itself,
0.6	0.9	that
0	0.4	was

0.2	0.6	as
0.5	0.8	could
0.6	0.7	be
0.9	0.5	expected.
0.9	0.4	
0.7	0.9	And
1	0	thus,
0.8	0.6	through

0.2	0.6	rather,
0.3	0.3	delivery
0.2	0.2	of
0.7	0	Tashtego,
1	0.9	was
0.6	0.7	successfully
0.8	0.9	accomplished,
0.6	0.7	in

0.5	0.5	of

0.5	0.2	is
0.1	0.3	a

0.4	0.8	
0.7	0.6	Midwifery

0.6	0.5	Not

0.2	0.7	It

0.7	0.5	the

0.9	0	A

0.3	0.6	
0.2	0.7	Now,
0.4	0	I
0.1	0.5	consider

0	0.1	
0.3	0.3	For
0.5	0.9	I
0.7	0.8	believe
0.6	0.3	that
0.4	0.2	much
0.1	0.9	of
0.5	0.9	a

0.8	0.3	
0.7	0.3	I

0.4	0.5	
0.3	0.5	I

0.6	0.4

0.6	0.1	
0.9	0.8	Now,

0.5	0.9	this

0.2	0.2	With

0.6	0.3	
0.5	0.6	It

0.8	0.6	
0.2	0.5	So
0.1	0.3	have
0.7	0.5	I
0.2	0.1	seen
0.8	0.3	a
0.2	0.8	bird
0.4	0.3	with

0.6	0.2	wing
0.8	0	making

0.5	0.6	
0.5	0.7	But
0.8	0.4	the

0.9	0.3	and
0.9	1	with

0.9	0.7	of

0.1	0.1	vast
1	0.5	dumb
0.2	0.8	brute
0.8	0.8	of
0.6	0.4	the

0.2	0.4	was
0.6	0.7	chained
0.7	0.9	up
0.6	0.3	and
0.8	0.8	enchanted
0.6	0.1	in
0	0.7	him;
0.5	0.5	he
0.1	0.8	had
1	0.8	no

0.1	0.9	respiration
0.9	0.1	through
0.8	0.4	his
0.6	0.8	spiracle,
0.8	0.4	and
0.5	0.4	this

0.4	0.5	the
0	0.5	sight
0.1	0.1	of
0.6	0.4	him
0	0.2	unspeakably
0.6	0.8	pitiable;
0.9	0.9	while
0.4	0.5	still,
0.5	0.1	in

0.4	0.4	amazing
0.7	0.3	bulk,

0.2	0.2	and
0.1	0.9	omnipotent

0.7	0.3	there
0.1	0.9	was
0.5	0.7	enough

0.4	0.6	man
1	0.6	who
0.8	0.2	so

0.6	0.1	few

0.8	0.9	Derick
0.5	0.5	chose
0.9	0.7	to

0	0.1	what
0.5	0.6	to

0.3	0.6	must

0.7	0.2	some

0.5	0.3	rather

0.6	0.3	pagans
0	0.7	of
0.1	0.9	their

0.6	0.3	equally

0.8	0.9	facts,
0.8	0.8	for
0.8	0.5	all
0.7	0.4	that.
0.4	1	
0.3	0.7	One
0.8	0.8	old
0.3	0.6	Sag-Harbor
0.2	0.5	whaleman's
0.9	0.5	chief
0.1	0.9	reason
0.9	0	for
0.3	0.7	questioning
0.6	0	the
0.2	0.3	Hebrew
0	0.1	story
0	0.8	was
0.5	0.4	this:--He
0.2	0.2	had
0.9	0.9	one
0.2	0.8	of
1	0.5	those
0.7	0.4	quaint
0.6	0.9	old-fashioned
0.5	0.5	Bibles,
0.2	0.3	embellished
0.6	0.3	with
0.3	0.6	curious,
0.3	0.3	unscientific
0.1	0.4	plates;
0.3	0.7	one
0.3	0.4	of
0.8	0.5	which
0.2	0.3	represented
0.9	0.3	Jonah's
0.6	0.1	whale
0.4	0.1	with
0.4	0.7	two
0.8	0.3	spouts
0.9	0.4	in
0.9	0.9	his
0.3	0.3	head--a
0.5	0.5	peculiarity
0.1	0.1	only
0.1	0.4	true
0.9	1	with
0.9	0.2	respect
0.3	0.3	to
0	0.8	a
0.8	0.8	species
0.8	0.5	of
0.7	0.4	the
0.1	0.7	Leviathan
0.1	0	(the
0.4	0.8	Right
0.5	0.2	Whale,
0.3	0.9	and
0.8	0.3	the
0.1	0.8	varieties
0.6	0.9	of
0.2	0.1	that
0.1	0.6	order),
0.6	0.4	concerning
0.8	0.9	which
0.4	0.2	the
0.2	0.8	fishermen
0.9	0.5	have
0.1	0.5	this
0.7	0	saying,
0.5	0.7	"A
0.7	0.9	penny
0.8	0.4	roll
0.5	0.6	would
0.1	0.9	choke
0.7	0.5	him";
0.5	0.5	his
0	0	swallow
0.2	0.2	is
0.1	0.3	so
0.1	0.3	very
0.1	0.2	small.
0.5	0.9	
0.2	0.2	But,
0.7	0.8	to
0.6	0.5	this,
0.1	0.5	Bishop
0	0.5	Jebb's
0.7	0.8	anticipative
0.6	0.4	answer
0.3	0.7	is
0.3	0.9	ready.
0.7	0.4	
0.1	0.6	It
0.4	0.7	is
0.7	0.9	not
0.2	0.4	necessary,
0.7	0	hints
0	0.4	the
0.3	0.6	Bishop,
0.8	0.7	that
0.8	0.4	we
0.1	0.7	consider
0.5	0.3	Jonah
0	0.9	as
0.3	0.8	tombed
0.5	0.4	in
0.3	0.7	the
0.8	0.8	whale's
0.4	0	belly,
0.5	0.5	but
0.8	0.8	as
0.4	0.2	temporarily
0.5	0.4	lodged
0.9	0.8	in
0.8	0.4	some
0.6	0.5	part
0.4	0.1	of
0.5	0.2	his
0	0.1	mouth.
0.1	0.9	
0.5	0.2	And
0.1	0.9	this
0	0	seems
0.4	0.2	reasonable
0.8	0.9	enough
0.7	0.8	in
0.6	0.1	the
0.6	0.9	good
0.1	0.3	Bishop.
0.2	0.8	
0.7	0.1	For
0.1	0.9	truly,
0.1	0.8	the
0.5	0.4	Right
0.5	0.7	Whale's
0.5	0.3	mouth
0.3	0.5	would
0.2	0.2	accommodate
0.3	0.1	a
0.4	0.6	couple
0.8	0.5	of
0.6	0.7	whist-tables,
0.6	0.2	and
0.4	0.7	comfortably
0	0.7	seat
0.1	0.6	all
0.7	0.2	the
0.2	0.7	players.
0.1	0.2	
0.6	0	Possibly,
0.8	0.5	too,
0.2	0.6	Jonah
0.7	0.1	might
0.9	0.8	have
0.7	0.4	ensconced
0.7	0.5	himself
0.9	0.2	in
0.4	0.6	a
1	0.5	hollow
0.9	0.4	tooth;
0	0.3	but,
0.2	0.8	on
0.7	0.2	second
0.8	0.8	thoughts,
0.8	0.8	the
0.5	0.9	Right
0.5	0.4	Whale
0	0.1	is
0.5	0.1	toothless.
0.9	0.7	
0.8	0.8	Another
0.4	0	reason
0.5	0.2	which
0.9	0.7	Sag-Harbor
0.1	0.7	(he
0.2	0.9	went
0.3	0.1	by
0.9	0.5	that
0.8	0.2	name)
0.8	0.5	urged
0.1	0.6	for
0.7	0.6	his
0.8	0.5	want
0.4	0.5	of
0	0.5	faith
0.4	0.3	in
0.2	0	this
0.5	0.6	matter
0.4	0.1	of
0.9	0.1	the
0.1	0.9	prophet,
0.9	0.5	was
0.5	0.5	something
0.6	0.3	obscurely
0.3	0.3	in
0.7	0	reference
0.9	0.9	to
0.3	0.8	his
0.7	0.2	incarcerated
0.4	0.7	body
0.7	0.1	and
0.7	0.5	the
0.9	0.2	whale's
0.3	0	gastric
0	0.8	juices.
0.5	0.1	But
0	0.3	this
0.9	0.7	objection
0.8	0.1	likewise
0.5	0.5	falls
0.5	0.1	to
0	0.6	the
0.3	0.8	ground,
0.3	0.2	because
0.1	0.2	a
0.5	1	German
0.8	0.4	exegetist
0.2	0.2	supposes
0.3	0.6	that
0.7	1	Jonah
0.6	0.7	must
0.3	0.9	have
0.8	0.7	taken
0.5	0.6	refuge
0.4	0.6	in
0.2	0.5	the
1	0.6	floating
0.6	0.9	body
0.1	0.8	of
0.9	0.6	a
0.1	0.3	DEAD
0.9	0.4	whale--even
0.5	0.6	as
0.5	0	the
0.5	0.5	French
0.6	0.8	soldiers
0.8	0.1	in
0.6	0.8	the
0.7	0.3	Russian
0.8	0.2	campaign
0.8	0.5	turned
1	0.3	their
0.8	0.6	dead
0.7	0.1	horses
0.8	0.7	into
0.9	0.6	tents,
0.1	0.3	and
0.1	0.8	crawled
0.5	0.3	into
0.3	0.3	them.
0.3	0.5	Besides,
1	0.1	it
0.8	0.1	has
0.1	0	been
0.8	0.1	divined
0.5	0.7	by
0.3	0.1	other
1	0.3	continental
0.8	0.6	commentators,
0.2	0.8	that
0.1	1	when
0.7	0.8	Jonah
0.4	0.5	was
0.1	0.1	thrown
0.3	0.4	overboard
0.3	0	from
0	0.3	the
0.5	0.7	Joppa
0.5	0.2	ship,
0.5	0.8	he
0.9	0.4	straightway
0.6	0.7	effected
0	0.6	his
1	0	escape
0.8	0.4	to
0.3	0.6	another
0.3	0.1	vessel
0.4	0	near
0.6	0	by,
0.3	0.1	some
0.3	0.9	vessel
0.9	0.1	with
0.7	0.2	a
1	0.9	whale
0.1	0.4	for
0.8	0.3	a
1	0.6	figure-head;
1	0.8	and,
0.5	0.6	I
0.2	0.2	would
0.5	0.3	add,
0.8	0.7	possibly
0	0.9	called
0.9	0.3	"The
0.4	0.5	Whale,"
0.6	0.9	as
0.1	0.9	some
0.7	0.3	craft
0.9	0.7	are
0	0.7	nowadays
0.2	0.7	christened
0.3	0	the
0.5	0	"Shark,"
0.8	1	the
0.6	0.8	"Gull,"
0	0.9	the
0.1	0.7	"Eagle."
0.2	0.2	
0.5	0.7	Nor
0.6	1	have
0.3	0.2	there
0.2	0.3	been
0.2	0.1	wanting
0.1	0.1	learned
0.4	0.4	exegetists
1	0.5	who
0.8	0.5	have
0.9	0.5	opined
0.9	0.9	that
0.4	0.1	the
1	0.1	whale
0.3	0.9	mentioned
0.1	0.9	in
0.5	0.3	the
0.1	0.9	book
1	0.8	of
0.2	0.8	Jonah
1	0.1	merely
0.6	0.4	meant
0.7	0.8	a
0.1	0.3	life-preserver--an
0.2	0.1	inflated
0.1	0.9	bag
0.6	0.3	of
0.3	0.7	wind--which
0.8	0.7	the
0.3	0.1	endangered
0.4	0.4	prophet
0.4	0.4	swam
0.1	0.4	to,
1	0.1	and
0.1	0.5	so
0.2	0.9	was
0.1	0.8	saved
0.1	0.1	from
0.3	0.4	a
0.7	1	watery
0.8	0.6	doom.
0.2	0.4	
0.3	0.6	Poor
0.1	0.9	Sag-Harbor,
0.1	0.7	therefore,
0.3	0	seems
0.7	1	worsted
0.9	0.7	all
0.5	0.6	round.
0.1	0	
0.5	0.2	But
0.1	0.2	he
0.5	0.9	had
0.2	0.6	still
0.1	0.3	another
0.8	0.8	reason
0.3	0.8	for
1	0.9	his
0.4	0.9	want
0	0.2	of
0.9	0	faith.
0.8	0.2	
0.5	0.6	It
0.2	0.3	was
0.4	0.9	this,
0.1	0.3	if
0.4	0.3	I
0.8	0	remember
0.4	0.9	right:
0.9	0.6	Jonah
0.4	0.9	was
0.6	0.9	swallowed
0.8	0.2	by
0.6	0.7	the
0.5	0.3	whale
0.2	0.6	in
0	0.8	the
0.5	0.3	Mediterranean
0.5	0.3	Sea,
0.7	0.9	and
0.5	0.9	after
0.1	0.6	three
0.3	0.8	days
0.1	0.5	he
0.3	1	was
1	0.3	vomited
0.1	0.7	up
0.9	0	somewhere
0.9	0.1	within
0.2	0.6	three
0.7	0.8	days'
0.1	0.7	journey
0.9	0.5	of
0.6	0.2	Nineveh,
0.9	0.8	a
0.8	0.6	city
0.6	0.3	on
0.5	0.7	the
1	0.8	Tigris,
0	0.1	very
0.1	0.8	much
0.6	0.5	more
0.8	0.5	than
0.2	0.6	three
0.3	0.7	days'
0.5	0.6	journey
0.5	0.3	across
0.8	0.9	from
0.3	0.4	the

0.8	0.1	of

0.1	0.8	
0.5	0.6	How
0.4	0.2	is
0.7	0.2	that?
0.9	0.5	
0.8	0.3	But
0.5	0.9	was
0.2	0.7	there
0.5	0.2	no
0.4	0.2	other
0.4	0.4	way
0.4	0.3	for
0	0.6	the

0.3	0.3	to

0.5	0.1	the

0.7	0.8	distance
0.1	0.6	of
1	0.4	Nineveh?
0.4	0.3	
0.7	0.1	Yes.
0.1	0.5	
0.3	0.3	He
1	0.7	might
0.5	0.7	have
0.9	0.5	carried
0.5	0.5	him
1	0.9	round
0.7	0.7	by
0.4	0.1	the

0.7	0.8	yet
0.2	0.4	be
0.5	0.1	arrived
0.3	0.6	at
0.9	0.8	on
0.6	0.1	this
0.3	0	head.
0.5	0.1	
0.4	0.5	Sure
0.2	1	it
0.5	0.5	is,
0.2	0.2	nevertheless,
0.3	0.1	that
0.3	0.8	the
0.2	0.4	Sperm
0.6	0.4	Whale
0.7	0.6	has
0.8	0.3	no
0.9	0.7	proper
0.5	0.8	olfactories.
0.4	0.7	
1	0.5	But
0.8	0.4	what
0.9	0.7	does
0.1	0.9	he
0	0.3	want
0.3	0.4	of
0.1	0.1	them?
0.1	0.1	
0.8	0.9	No
0.1	0.9	roses,
0.4	0.9	no
0.4	0.8	violets,
0.3	0.7	no
0.3	0.5	Cologne-water
0.5	0.6	in
0.9	0.5	the
0.3	0.9	sea.
0.7	0.7	
0.5	0.4	Furthermore,
0.4	0.2	as
0.3	0.3	his
0.4	0	windpipe
0.4	0.9	solely
0.4	0.6	opens
0.5	0.7	into
0.7	0.9	the

0.6	0.9	of
0.2	0.8	his
0.5	0.6	spouting
0.7	0.7	canal,
0.2	0.2	and
0.7	0.6	as
0.7	0.5	that
0	0.5	long
0.7	0.6	canal--like
0.3	0.2	the
0.5	0.3	grand
0.6	1	Erie
0.2	0.1	Canal--is
0.4	0.8	furnished
0.7	0.1	with
0.4	0.2	a

1	0.3	of

0.7	0.8	(that
0.6	0.1	open
0.5	0.8	and
0.3	0.6	shut)
0.7	0.5	for

0.2	0.4	or
0	1	the
0.5	0.2	upward
0.5	0.2	exclusion
0.3	0.8	of
0.3	0.6	water,
0.4	0.8	therefore
0.7	0.1	the
0.5	0.6	whale
0.1	0.7	has
0.9	0.8	no
0.3	0.1	voice;
0.2	0.1	unless
0.3	0.2	you
0.6	0.9	insult
0.4	0.1	him
0.5	0.1	by
0.7	1	saying,
0.1	0.3	that
1	0.3	when
0.3	0.8	he
0.1	0.6	so
0.5	0.8	strangely
0	1	rumbles,
0.4	0	he
0.4	0.8	talks
0.9	0.6	through
0.5	0.3	his
0.9	0	nose.
0.5	0.8	
0.3	0.4	But
0.8	0.6	then
0.3	0.2	again,
0.7	0.8	what
0.3	0.2	has
0.1	1	the
0.8	0.7	whale
0.1	0.8	to
0.7	0.9	say?
0.3	0.7	
0.8	0.9	Seldom
0.3	0.6	have
0.8	0.8	I
1	0.7	known
0.3	0.5	any
0.8	0.2	profound
0.9	0.9	being
0.1	0.1	that

0.4	0.3	to

0.7	0.4	out
0.3	0.5	something
0	0.6	by
0.9	0.4	way
0.6	0.9	of
0.1	0.9	getting
0.8	0.4	a
0.9	0.2	living.
0.7	0.1	
0.1	0.2	Oh!
0.6	0.6	happy
0.1	0.1	that
0.7	0.5	the
0.7	0.7	world
0.1	1	is
0.1	0	such
0.9	0.5	an
0.5	0.1	excellent
0.9	0.5	listener!
0.1	0.8	
0.1	0.3	Now,
0	0.5	the
0.3	0.6	spouting
0.1	0.6	canal
0.9	0.4	of
0.1	0.7	the
0	0	Sperm
0.5	1	Whale,
0.7	0.1	chiefly
0.1	0.1	intended
0.5	0.9	as
0.5	0.7	it
0.2	1	is
0.4	0.2	for
0.2	0.8	the
0.1	0.8	conveyance
0.6	0	of
0.5	0.5	air,
0.2	0	and
0.5	0	for
0.9	1	several
0.6	0.1	feet
0	0.7	laid
0.5	0.4	along,
0.1	0.5	horizontally,
0.3	0.5	just
0.5	0.9	beneath
0.6	0.1	the
0.4	1	upper
0.5	0.4	surface
1	1	of
0.2	0.8	his
0.7	0.1	head,
0.7	0.5	and
0	0.3	a
0.9	0.7	little
0.4	0.3	to
0.5	0.2	one
0.1	0.6	side;
1	0.3	this
0.1	0.2	curious
0.1	0.3	canal
0.8	0.8	is
0.3	0.9	very
1	0	much
0.7	0.2	like
0.1	0.9	a
0.5	0.3	gas-pipe
0.1	0.6	laid
0.4	0.1	down
0.6	0.1	in
0.3	0.9	a

0.3	0.3	on
0.4	0.7	one
0.4	0.4	side
0.5	0.7	of
0.3	0.2	a
0.2	0.1	street.
0.3	0.3	
0.3	0.1	But
0.9	0.3	the
0.2	0.9	question
0.9	0.8	returns
0.8	0.2	whether
0.5	0.9	this
0.5	0	gas-pipe
0.7	0.6	is
0.9	0.9	also
0.8	0.9	a
0.9	0.1	water-pipe;
0	0.2	in
0.1	0.8	other
0.1	0.7	words,
0.8	1	whether
0.6	0.4	the
0.2	0.9	spout
0	0.7	of
0.4	0.2	the
0.5	0.7	Sperm
0.1	0.3	Whale
0.5	0.7	is
0.1	1	the
0.4	0.7	mere
0.1	0.4	vapour
0.8	0.4	of
0.4	0.9	the
0.7	0	exhaled
1	0.3	breath,
0.4	0.1	or
0.9	0.1	whether
0.6	0.6	that
0.7	0.1	exhaled
0.6	0.7	breath
0.2	0.7	is
0.1	0.9	mixed
0.3	0.6	with
0.8	0.2	water
0.5	0	taken
0.3	0.3	in
1	0.3	at
0.3	0.8	the
0.7	0.6	mouth,
0.9	0.3	and
0.1	0.4	discharged
0.9	0.9	through
0.1	0.5	the
0.3	0.1	spiracle.
0.9	1	
0.6	0.3	It
0.5	0.5	is
0.4	0.1	certain
0.7	0.6	that
0.8	0.1	the
0.9	0.6	mouth
0.4	0.8	indirectly
0	0.1	communicates
0.4	0.7	with
0.5	0.7	the
0.5	0.9	spouting
0.9	0.9	canal;
0.6	0.5	but
0.2	0.2	it
0	0.8	cannot
0.5	0.2	be
0.7	0.5	proved
0.3	0.7	that
0.3	0.7	this
0.5	1	is
0.8	0.5	for
0.4	0.8	the
0.2	1	purpose
0.5	0.6	of
0.1	0.9	discharging
0.3	0.8	water
0.3	0.6	through
0	0.7	the
0.4	0.8	spiracle.
0.6	0.1	
0.8	0.1	Because
0.3	0.9	the
0.1	0.8	greatest
0.1	0.8	necessity
0.5	0	for
0	0.5	so
0.1	0.1	doing
0.4	1	would
0.2	0.4	seem
0.1	0.2	to
0.3	0.4	be,
0.6	1	when
0.4	0.4	in
0.8	0.8	feeding
0.9	0.8	he
0.8	0.5	accidentally
0.2	0.5	takes
0.3	0.6	in
0.8	0.9	water.
0.7	0.7	But
1	0.8	the
0.5	0.1	Sperm
0.6	0.1	Whale's
0.6	0.2	food
0.1	0.2	is
0.1	0.6	far
0.1	0.7	beneath
0.6	0.3	the
0.9	0.6	surface,
0.5	0.3	and
0.1	0.7	there
0.9	0.8	he
0.4	0.9	cannot
0.1	0.3	spout
0.4	0.7	even
0.6	0.1	if
0.2	0	he
0.8	0.1	would.
0.3	0.4	
0	1	Besides,
0.6	0.8	if
0.4	1	you
0.6	0.7	regard
0.4	0.5	him
0.9	0.7	very
0.5	0.4	closely,
0.5	0.8	and
1	0.2	time
0.5	0.5	him
0.6	0.3	with
0.1	0.1	your
0.9	0.8	watch,
0.7	0	you
0.9	0.2	will
0.7	0.4	find
1	0.1	that
0.3	0.2	when
0.5	0	unmolested,
0.5	0.9	there
0.7	0.7	is
0.7	0.5	an
0.1	0	undeviating
0.6	0.7	rhyme
0	0.3	between
0.5	0	the
0.3	0.2	periods
0.8	0.3	of
0.2	0.8	his
1	0.3	jets
0.4	0.9	and
0.7	0.8	the

0.2	0.6	periods
0.2	0.8	of
0.1	0.1	respiration.
0.2	0.8	
0.7	0.3	But
0.3	0.9	why
0.8	0.5	pester
0.5	0.1	one
0.7	0.7	with
0.8	0.6	all
0.4	0.3	this
0.4	0.7	reasoning
0.7	0.7	on
0.3	0.2	the
0.5	0.9	subject?
0.7	0.1	
0.1	0.6	Speak
0.1	1	out!
0.3	0.1	
0.4	0.8	You
0.3	0.2	have
0.2	0.3	seen
0.3	0.1	him
0.4	0.4	spout;
0.1	0.3	then
0.7	0.2	declare
0.9	0.7	what
0.8	0.4	the

0.7	0	is;
0.6	0.5	can
0.5	0.7	you
0.4	1	not
0.3	0.4	tell
0.9	0.6	water
0.5	0.2	from

0.8	0.6	
0.3	0.1	My
0.6	0.2	dear
0.8	0.1	sir,
0.3	0.5	in
0.1	0.3	this
0.1	0.7	world
0.8	0.5	it
0.1	0.4	is
0.4	0.1	not
0.5	0.7	so
0.9	0.3	easy
1	0.5	to
0.9	0.3	settle
0.7	0.7	these
0.9	1	plain
0.8	0.4	things.
0.3	0.6	
0.2	0.7	I
0.1	0	have
0.8	0.2	ever
0.6	0.1	found
0.9	0.7	your

0.7	0.3	the

0.1	0.2	of

0.4	0.2	
0	0.6	And
0.1	0.1	as
0.3	0.3	for
0.8	0.8	this
0.8	0.7	whale
0.1	0.8	spout,
0.9	0.5	you
0.3	0.8	might
0.3	0.8	almost
0.8	0.8	stand
0.9	0.1	in
0	0.1	it,
1	0.9	and
0.4	1	yet
0.5	0.1	be
0.8	0.5	undecided
0.4	0.4	as
0.7	0	to
0.8	0.4	what
0.8	0.7	it
0.4	0.7	is
0.2	0.2	precisely.
0.4	0.7	
0.6	0.1	The
0	0.3	central

0.5	0.1	of

0.7	0	enveloping
0.1	0.9	it;
1	0.4	and
0.3	0.4	how
0.2	0.7	can
0.3	0	you
0.9	0.8	certainly
0.8	0	tell
0.6	0.9	whether
0.3	0.8	any

0.1	0.2	falls

0.6	0.2	it,
0.5	0.6	when,
0.4	1	always,
0.3	0.1	when

0.5	0.8	
0.7	0.2	And

0.3	0.7	you

0.6	0.6	it
0.8	0.2	away.
0.2	0.5	
0.3	0.5	For
0.4	0.3	even
0.9	0.3	when
0.6	0.8	coming
0	0.7	into
0.4	0.6	slight
0.9	0.1	contact
0.8	0.3	with
0.4	0.4	the
0.8	0	outer,
0.3	0.5	vapoury
0.8	0.5	shreds
0.3	0.6	of
0.6	0.5	the
0.8	0.9	jet,
0.5	0.5	which
0.9	0.4	will
0.7	0.8	often
1	0.2	happen,
0.8	0.4	your
0.5	0.3	skin
0.5	0.5	will
0.2	0.6	feverishly
0.3	0.1	smart,
0.7	0.7	from
0.8	0.4	the
0.5	0.3	acridness
0.9	0	of
0.9	0.9	the
0.4	0.1	thing
0.6	0.6	so
0.2	0.4	touching
0.2	0.5	it.
0.1	0.6	
0.4	0.6	And
0.2	0.2	I
0.6	0.6	know
0.5	0.3	one,
0.9	0.7	who
0.7	0.2	coming
0.3	0	into
1	0.1	still
0.3	0.5	closer
0.3	0.8	contact
1	0.1	with
0.6	0.9	the
0.8	0.9	spout,
0.5	0.3	whether
0.7	0.6	with
0.3	0.9	some
0.7	0.6	scientific
0.6	0.1	object
0.8	0.6	in
0.1	0.1	view,
0.1	0.3	or
0.4	0.9	otherwise,
0.2	0.8	I
0.7	0.2	cannot
0.3	1	say,
0.1	0.4	the
0.5	0.5	skin
0.1	1	peeled
0.9	0.5	off
0.3	0.3	from
0	0.8	his
0.8	0.6	cheek
0.5	0.8	and
0.5	0.8	arm.
0.3	0.6	
0.7	0.5	Wherefore,
0.8	0.9	among
0.7	0.6	whalemen,
0.1	0.6	the
0.2	0.9	spout
0.7	0.5	is
0.3	0.8	deemed
0.3	0.3	poisonous;
0.4	0.7	they
0.5	0.7	try
0.5	0.9	to
0.9	1	evade
0.9	0.8	it.
0.6	0.4	
0.7	0.3	Another
0.6	0.7	thing;
0.4	0.4	I
0.8	0.8	have
0.4	0.6	heard
0.9	0.6	it
0.3	0.6	said,
0.3	0.4	and
0.6	0.8	I
0.6	0.1	do
0.8	0.8	not
0	0.9	much
0.4	0.5	doubt
0.6	0.3	it,
0.6	0.8	that
0	0.8	if
0.5	0.5	the
0.8	0.5	jet
0.3	0.4	is
1	0.4	fairly
0.2	0.2	spouted
0.8	0.3	into
0.6	0.7	your
0.5	0.9	eyes,
0.7	0.6	it
0.9	0.4	will
0.8	0.1	blind
0.6	0.4	you.
0.5	0.5	
0.1	0.8	The
0.9	0.8	wisest
0	0	thing
0.9	0.2	the
0.7	0.4	investigator
0.2	0.7	can
0.9	0.6	do
0.7	0.1	then,
0.7	0.7	it
0	0.7	seems
0.1	0.6	to
0.9	0.6	me,
0.5	0.2	is
0.9	0.1	to
0	0.7	let
0.2	0.6	this
0.1	0.9	deadly
0.5	0.7	spout
0	0.5	alone.
0.8	0.8	
0.3	0.7	Still,
0.5	0.5	we
0.2	0.7	can
0.3	0.7	hypothesize,
0.1	0.8	even
0.5	0.7	if
0.6	0.5	we
0.1	0	cannot
0.8	0.5	prove
0.9	0.6	and
0.2	0.3	establish.
0.4	0.4	
0.5	0.2	My
0.6	0.9	hypothesis
0.7	1	is
0.9	0.7	this:
0.1	0.5	that
0	0.5	the
0.7	0.1	spout
0.9	0.5	is
0.1	0.4	nothing
0.5	0.6	but
0.7	0.2	mist.
0.9	0.4	
0.2	0.5	And
0.1	0.6	besides
0	0.4	other
0	0.9	reasons,
0.5	0.9	to
0.7	0.6	this
0.3	0.7	conclusion
0.1	0.7	I
0.4	0.4	am
0.3	0.9	impelled,
0.5	1	by
0.3	0.7	considerations
0.4	0.3	touching
0.6	0.5	the
0.8	0.8	great
0.4	1	inherent
0.2	0.7	dignity
0.5	0	and
1	0	sublimity
0	0	of
1	1	the
0.5	0.5	Sperm
1	1	Whale;
0.5	0.1	I
0.9	0.7	account
0.8	0.3	him
0.7	0.3	no
0.7	0.2	common,
0.1	0.5	shallow
0.4	0.7	being,
0.5	0	inasmuch
0.7	0.4	as
0.4	0.7	it
0.8	0.7	is
0.9	0.6	an
0.1	0.6	undisputed
0.8	0.1	fact
0	0.1	that
0.4	0.1	he
0.1	0.6	is
0.4	0.5	never
0.2	0.3	found
0.8	0	on
0.6	0.8	soundings,
0	0.5	or
0.1	0.6	near
0.1	0.1	shores;
0.4	0.7	all
0.1	0.8	other
0.3	0.2	whales
0.7	0.4	sometimes
0.3	0.3	are.
0.5	0.9	
0.9	0.7	He
0	0.5	is
0.7	0.4	both
0.1	0.3	ponderous
0.5	0.6	and
0.5	0.4	profound.
0.8	0	And
0.9	0.3	I
0.8	0.9	am
1	0.4	convinced
0.8	0.3	that
1	0.3	from
0	0.7	the
0.7	0.2	heads
0	0.5	of
0	0.7	all
0.3	0.5	ponderous
0.5	0.2	profound
0.5	0.5	beings,
0.1	0.4	such
0.3	0.9	as
0.3	0.1	Plato,
0.7	0.5	Pyrrho,
0.3	0.6	the
0.2	0.9	Devil,
0.1	1	Jupiter,
0.9	0.6	Dante,
0.4	0.2	and
0.2	0.1	so
0.9	0.2	on,
0.8	0.1	there
0.9	0.4	always
0.6	0.1	goes
0.7	0.7	up
0.6	0.5	a
0.2	0.1	certain
0.8	0.1	semi-visible
0.5	0.1	steam,
0.1	0.7	while
0.8	0.7	in

0.7	0.8	
0.8	0.7	While
0.1	0.7	composing

0	0.6	little
0.2	0.8	treatise
0.3	0.2	on
0.8	0.9	Eternity,
0.7	0.2	I
0.3	1	had
1	0.5	the
0.8	0.8	curiosity
0.4	0.3	to
0.2	0.1	place
0.5	0.6	a
0.1	0.7	mirror
1	0.5	before
0.9	0.1	me;
0.1	0.9	and
0.5	0.9	ere
0.7	0.4	long
0.8	0.5	saw
0.8	0.4	reflected
0.6	0.6	there,
0.4	0.4	a
0.3	0.6	curious
0.3	0.1	involved
0.4	0.8	worming
0.4	0.7	and

0.3	0.1	in
0.3	0.9	the

0.8	0.8	over
0.1	0	my
0.9	0.3	head.
0.6	0.7	
0.4	0.4	The
0.1	0.9	invariable
0.9	0.6	moisture
0.2	0.3	of
0	0.8	my
0.2	0.8	hair,
0.2	0.7	while
0.5	0.8	plunged
0.4	0.6	in
0.1	0.7	deep
0.8	0.7	thought,
0	1	after
0.9	0.1	six
0.3	0.7	cups
0.8	0.6	of
0.4	0.8	hot
0.4	0.6	tea
0.5	0.1	in

0.4	0.9	attic,
0.4	0.8	of
0.1	0.8	an
0.6	0.2	August
0.2	0.9	noon;
0.5	0.4	this
0.7	0.5	seems
0.8	0.3	an
0.7	0.1	additional
0.3	0.2	argument
0.7	0.8	for
0.9	0.3	the
0.2	0.7	above

1	0.8	
0.8	0.1	And
0.2	0.5	how
0.7	1	nobly
0.9	0.7	it
0.9	0.1	raises
0.9	0.2	our
0.9	0.5	conceit
0.4	0.7	of
0.8	0.7	the
1	0.7	mighty,
0.9	0.8	misty

0.9	0.5	by

0.3	0.7	will
0.1	0.2	still
0.4	0.3	do
0	0.4	it;
0.2	0.8	notwithstanding
0.5	0.1	the

0.9	0.1	
0.6	0.4	Coming
0.3	0.9	still
0.1	0	nearer
0.2	0.5	with
0.7	0.3	the
0.1	0.4	expiring
0.9	0.6	breeze,
0.9	0.4	we
0.7	0.7	saw
0.8	0.8	that
0.8	0.2	the

0.7	0.9	
0.7	0.2	In
0.4	0.8	truth,
0	0.9	it
0.5	0.6	turned
0.6	0.2	out
0.2	0.6	to
0.5	0.1	be
1	0.8	one
0.8	0	of
0.8	0.9	those
0.7	0.2	problematical
0.4	0.5	whales
0.6	0.6	that
0.9	0.6	seem
0.8	0.7	to
0.6	0.8	dry
0.7	0.2	up

0.9	0.1	die

0.6	0.1	
0.6	0.7	Poor
0.1	0.4	devil!
0.8	0.5	
0.5	0.2	I
0.6	0.3	say,
0.3	0.5	pass

1	0.1	some
0.6	0.9	one,

0.7	0.2	of

0.2	0.7	that
0.5	0.9	drugged
0.2	0.9	whale
0	0	there,
0.9	0.2	wouldn't
0.4	0.3	be
0.6	0.2	fit
0.3	0.6	to

0.1	0.7	in
0.8	0	a

0	1	
0.2	0	And

0.4	0.1	for
0.3	0.3	the
0.6	0.4	other
0.7	0.6	whale,
0.5	0.7	why,
0.8	0.1	I'll
0.2	0.8	agree
0.7	0.7	to
0.7	0.8	get
1	0	more
0.8	0.8	oil
0.4	0.3	by
1	0.7	chopping
0.1	0.7	up
0.3	0.8	and
0.6	0.1	trying

0.7	0.8	of
0.3	0.7	bones;
0.2	0.6	though,
0.4	0.3	now
0.2	1	that
0.2	0.3	I
1	0.1	think
0.4	1	of
0.2	0.4	it,
0.3	0.5	it
0.5	0.8	may
0.3	0.5	contain
0.1	0.9	something

0.2	0.9	yes,
0.2	0.1	ambergris.
0.2	0.7	
0.6	0.1	I
0.8	0.6	wonder
0.8	0.6	now
0.6	0.6	if
1	0.9	our

0	0.3	
0.9	0.6	It's

0.5	0.7	Yes,

0.9	0.5	and
0.4	0.9	so
0.3	1	saying
0.9	0.3	he

0.3	0.6	
0.5	0.1	By

0.8	1	the

0.7	0.1	the

0.7	0.1	now
0.9	0.1	fairly

0.1	0.2	
0.2	0.6	Issuing

0.1	0.2	turning
0.3	0.9	to

0.2	0.9	had
0.8	0.9	a

0.5	0	him
1	0.3	carefully,
0.5	0.1	Stubb
0.3	0	further
0.9	0.5	perceived

0.6	0.9	quickly
0.5	0.8	concocted
0.7	0.3	a

0.5	0.5	both
0	0.7	circumventing
0.8	0.3	and
0.5	0	satirizing
0.1	0.8	the

0.9	0.9	this

0.5	0.3	a

0.1	0.4	curious
0	0.9	substance,
0.4	0.1	and
0	0.9	so
0.3	0.3	important
0.9	0.7	as

0.9	0.5	remained,
0.7	0.1	like

0.8	0.2	a

0.5	0.3	to

0.5	0.7	
0	0.9	Though

0.8	0.2	are
0.3	0.3	quite
0.7	0.8	distinct.

0.5	0.1	For
0.3	0.3	amber,
0.6	0.4	though

0.7	0.3	
0.2	0.9	Besides,
0.3	0.5	amber
0.9	0.2	is
0.8	0.6	a

0.9	0.4	
0.3	0.4	Who

0.9	0.4	that

0.4	0.8	fine
0.1	0.8	ladies
0.8	0.1	and
0.5	0.6	gentlemen
0.9	0.6	should

0.3	0.9	
0.2	0.1	Yet
0.1	0.6	so

0.6	0.9	is.
0.9	0.7	
0.1	0.3	By
0.7	0.6	some,
0.3	0.4	ambergris
0.7	0.4	is
0	0.6	supposed
0.1	1	to
0.7	0.2	be
0.5	0.8	the

0.1	0.5	and
0.7	0.7	by

0.5	0.3	the

1	0.8	of

0.9	0.6	
0.9	0.7	How
0.3	0.5	to

0.2	0.2	such
0.6	0.1	a
0.8	0.1	dyspepsia
0.3	0.9	it
0.9	0	were

0.9	0.8	
0.1	0.9	I
0.8	0.5	have
0.1	0.2	forgotten
0.6	0.5	to

0.5	0.3	that
0.6	0.8	there
0.4	0.4	were

0.5	0.8	but
0.5	0.3	it
0.4	0.8	afterwards
0.5	0.1	turned
0.7	0.8	out
1	0.2	that
0.9	0.9	they
0.1	0.7	were
0.2	0.2	nothing
0.4	0	more

0.7	0.2	
0.3	0	Now
0.6	0.1	that

0.3	0.8	this

0.7	0.8	
0.7	0.3	Bethink
0.9	0.6	thee

0.5	0.6	how
0.5	1	that

0.4	0.8	And
0.4	0.8	likewise
0.3	0.2	call

0.5	0.1	
0.6	0.6	Also
0.5	0.2	forget
0.8	0.7	not
1	0.8	the
0.8	0.3	strange
0.4	0.5	fact
0.8	0	that
0.8	0.1	of

0.7	0.4	
0.3	0	I

0.7	0.2	but
1	0.9	cannot,
0.3	0.3	owing
0.1	0.3	to
0.6	0.6	my

0.3	0	to

0.7	0.8	a

0.5	0.7	against

0.6	0.2	and
0.4	0.2	which,
0.7	0.5	in
0.9	0.4	the

0	0.5	of
0.6	0.3	some
0.1	0.1	already
0.3	0.3	biased
0.8	1	minds,
0.9	0.3	might
0.6	0.2	be
0.2	0.6	considered
0.3	0.7	as
0.5	0.8	indirectly
0.9	0.9	substantiated
0.4	0.2	by
0.1	0.7	what
0.7	0.8	has
0.2	0.5	been
0.3	0.2	said
0.5	0.3	of
0.7	0	the
0.8	0.6	Frenchman's
0.2	0.5	two
0.4	0.9	whales.
0.2	0.1	
0.8	0.3	Elsewhere
0	0.9	in
0.1	0.9	this
0.9	0.6	volume
1	0.3	the
0.9	0.4	slanderous
0	0.6	aspersion
0.7	0.4	has
0.2	0.8	been
0.9	0.7	disproved,
0.1	0.2	that
0.7	0.7	the
0.2	0.6	vocation
0.7	0.5	of
0.8	0.4	whaling
0.8	0.3	is
0.7	0.5	throughout

0.7	0.9	slatternly,
0.7	0.4	untidy
0.5	0.9	business.
0.4	0.3	
0.5	0.6	But
0.3	0.3	there
0.3	0.4	is
0.4	0.1	another
0.5	1	thing
0.3	0.7	to
0.1	0.4	rebut.
0.4	0.9	
0.1	0.9	They
0.9	0.3	hint
0.5	0.4	that
0.8	0.6	all
0.3	0.5	whales
0.2	0.3	always
0.2	0.7	smell
0.1	1	bad.
0.1	0	
0.5	0.7	Now
0.2	0.2	how
0.1	0.3	did
0.3	0.2	this
0.8	0.3	odious
0.9	0.1	stigma
0.9	0.8	originate?
0.1	0.6	
0.5	0.8	I
0.2	0.5	opine,
0	0.5	that
0.1	0.7	it
0.1	0.8	is
0.7	0	plainly
0.9	0.6	traceable
0	0.6	to
0.4	0.5	the

1	0.4	than
1	0.7	two

0.1	0.6	Because
0.7	0.3	those
0.5	0.4	whalemen
0.1	0.7	did
0.1	0.8	not
0.4	0.8	then,
0.7	0.7	and
0.4	0.3	do
0.7	0.9	not

0.9	0.9	try

0.7	0.7	their

0.1	0.1	poor

0.8	0.3	
0.7	0.7	In

1	0.8	It

0.5	0.1	It

0	0.6	in
0.7	0.9	the

0.2	0.7	the

0.1	0.8	this

0.5	0.8	when,
0.8	0.2	with

0.6	0.7	A

0.1	0.5	No

0.4	0.1	round
0.9	0	her
0.3	0.8	on

0.8	0.5	then
0.7	0.6	the

0.4	0.5	Pequod,
0.5	0.2	freighted
0.7	0.5	with

0.1	0.3	
0	0.9	So

0.3	0.8	to
0.2	0.2	me,
0.1	0.2	as
0.8	0.9	I
0.8	0.4	stood

0.8	0.4	for

0.6	0.6	silently

0.4	0.7	
0.3	0.9	Wrapped,

0.1	0.2	that
0.7	0.4	interval,
0.8	0.5	in
0.8	0.7	darkness
0	0.3	myself,
0.1	0.3	I
0.5	1	but
0.1	0.9	the
0.9	0.3	better
0.3	0.1	saw
0.4	0.3	the

0.1	0.8	the
0.6	0.7	madness,
0	0.2	the
0.2	0.2	ghastliness
1	0.9	of
0.9	0.4	others.
0.1	0.5	
1	0.7	The

0.8	0.3	sight
0.3	0.6	of
0.4	0.7	the

0.9	0.5	shapes
0.1	0.9	before

0.8	0	capering
0.1	0.5	half
0.5	1	in
0.2	1	smoke
0.3	0.5	and
0.9	0.1	half
0.1	0.4	in

0.6	0.5	these
0.8	0	at
0.5	0.2	last
0.2	0.8	begat
0.4	0.8	kindred
0.6	0.3	visions
0.7	0.1	in
0.5	0.4	my
0.4	0.5	soul,
0.5	0.7	so
0.6	0.2	soon
0.2	0.8	as
0.4	0	I
0.8	0.6	began
0.5	0.4	to
0	0.7	yield
0.6	0.6	to
0.3	0.2	that
0.8	0.8	unaccountable
0	0.5	drowsiness
0.5	0.6	which
0	0.8	ever
0.4	0.8	would
0.7	0.5	come
0.8	0.8	over
0.3	0.9	me
0.4	0.6	at
0.6	0.4	a
0.5	0.5	midnight
0.3	0.2	helm.
0.9	1	
0	0.7	But
0.6	0.6	that
0.2	0	night,
0.3	0.5	in
1	0.9	particular,
0.6	0.8	a
0.8	1	strange
0.4	0.6	(and
1	0.5	ever
0.3	0.5	since
0.5	0.1	inexplicable)
0.6	1	thing
0.2	0.9	occurred
0.9	0.8	to
0.1	0.4	me.
0.7	0.7	
0.4	0.1	Starting
0.9	0.7	from
0.8	0.1	a
0.3	0.5	brief
0.2	0.5	standing
0.2	0.1	sleep,
0.1	1	I
0.1	0.6	was
0.5	0.7	horribly
0.3	0.6	conscious
0.7	0.6	of
0.7	0.4	something
0.1	0.7	fatally
0.5	0.6	wrong.
0.7	0.4	
0.3	0.5	The
0.2	0.8	jaw-bone
0.3	0.5	tiller
0.5	0.8	smote
0.5	1	my
0.7	0.4	side,
0.7	0.6	which
0.8	0.2	leaned
0.5	0.7	against
0.9	0.5	it;
0.8	0.6	in
0.8	0.5	my
0.9	0.6	ears
0.3	0	was
0.3	0.2	the
0.8	0.3	low
0.5	0.6	hum
0.3	0.5	of
0.1	0.3	sails,
0.7	0.7	just
0.5	0.3	beginning
0.3	0.6	to
1	0	shake
0.3	0.2	in
0.3	0.8	the
0.2	0.7	wind;
0.1	0.1	I
0.4	0.8	thought
0.5	0.9	my
0.8	0.3	eyes
0.7	0.5	were
1	0.5	open;
0.5	0.2	I
0.8	0.7	was
0.5	0.9	half
0.3	0.5	conscious
0.6	0.2	of
0.8	0.1	putting
0	1	my
0.3	0.1	fingers
0.9	0.9	to
0.4	0.7	the
0.1	0.9	lids
0.3	0.8	and
0.5	0.6	mechanically
0.6	0.6	stretching
0.9	0.9	them
0.2	0.1	still
0.6	0.7	further
0.5	0.5	apart.
0.5	0.6	But,
0.5	1	spite
0.1	0.7	of
0.1	0.1	all
0.9	0.4	this,
0.3	0.2	I
0.1	0.7	could
0.3	0.5	see
0.3	0.8	no
0.1	0.3	compass
0.2	0.8	before
0.7	0.1	me
0.2	0.3	to
0.8	1	steer
0.5	0.6	by;
0.5	0.9	though
0.5	0.3	it
0.1	0.4	seemed
0.2	0.8	but
0.4	0.5	a
0.3	0.8	minute
0.8	0.8	since
0.9	0.5	I
0.7	0.8	had
0.3	1	been
0.1	0.9	watching
0.5	0.1	the
0.1	0.7	card,
0.8	0.9	by
0.7	0.6	the
0.4	0.6	steady
0.9	0.5	binnacle
0.4	0.9	lamp
0	0.9	illuminating
0.9	0.3	it.
0.3	0.1	
0.5	0.8	Nothing
0.3	0.2	seemed
0.8	0.2	before
0.3	0.1	me
0.8	0.5	but
0.2	0.6	a
0	0.8	jet
0.8	0.4	gloom,
0.6	1	now
0.3	0.5	and
0.3	0.7	then
0.3	1	made
1	0.4	ghastly
0.2	0.3	by
0	0.7	flashes
0.8	0.9	of
0.1	0.8	redness.
0.2	0.4	Uppermost
0	0.8	was
0.3	0.1	the
0.6	0.5	impression,
0	0.1	that
0.3	0.1	whatever
0.8	0.7	swift,
0.1	0.5	rushing
0.3	0.8	thing
0.3	0.2	I
0.6	0.8	stood
0.3	1	on
0.1	0.4	was
0.4	0.7	not
0.8	0.2	so
0.8	0.3	much
0.7	0.7	bound
1	0.3	to
0.2	0.7	any
0.5	0.8	haven
0.4	0.2	ahead
1	0.7	as
0.5	0.4	rushing
0.8	0.4	from
0.5	0.9	all
0.7	0.5	havens
0.9	0.8	astern.
0.7	0.8	
0	0.3	A
0.3	0.7	stark,
0.8	0.6	bewildered
0.1	0.1	feeling,
0.6	0	as
0.5	0.3	of
0.2	0.5	death,
0.1	0.1	came
0.1	0.1	over
0.9	0.2	me.
0.2	0.8	
0.6	0.1	Convulsively
0.7	0.4	my
0.2	0.5	hands
0.5	0.9	grasped
0.3	0.9	the
0.3	0.1	tiller,
0.1	0	but
0.4	0.8	with
0.5	0.3	the
0.4	0.5	crazy
0.9	0.8	conceit
0.8	0.1	that
0.3	0.2	the
0.6	0	tiller
0	0.7	was,
0.1	0.9	somehow,
0.9	0.9	in
0.1	0.8	some
0.6	0.8	enchanted
0.5	0.2	way,
0.3	0.7	inverted.
0.5	0.6	
0.6	0.2	My
0.6	0.5	God!
0.4	0.6	what
0.2	0.9	is
0.6	0.4	the
0.2	0.2	matter
0.8	0.3	with
0.8	0.1	me?
0.9	0.8	thought
0.3	0.3	I.
0.5	0.3	
0.7	0.3	Lo!
0.5	0.8	in
1	0.5	my
0.7	0.5	brief
0.1	0.4	sleep
0.8	0.6	I
0.8	0.5	had
0.1	0.3	turned
0.7	0.1	myself
0.5	0	about,
0.3	0.8	and
0.1	0.5	was
0.1	0.4	fronting
0.2	0.6	the
0.9	0	ship's
0.9	0.9	stern,
0.8	0.5	with
0.6	0.4	my
0.4	0.8	back
1	0.4	to
0.2	0.3	her
0.6	0.9	prow
0.9	0.1	and
0.6	0.1	the
0.3	0.1	compass.
0.5	0.5	
0.7	0.4	In
0.7	0.5	an
0.7	0.6	instant
0.4	0.3	I
0.8	0.9	faced
0.1	0.4	back,
0.9	0.3	just
0.1	0.3	in
0.5	0.7	time
0.8	0.9	to
1	0.8	prevent
0.8	0	the
0.8	0.5	vessel
0.7	0.8	from
0.5	0.1	flying
0.2	0.4	up
0	0.4	into
0.9	0.9	the
0.1	0.9	wind,
0.4	0.1	and
0.1	0.3	very
0.1	0.1	probably
0.6	0.1	capsizing
0.1	0.3	her.
0.8	0.6	
0.9	0.8	How
0.3	0.8	glad
0.3	0.4	and
0.9	0.3	how
0.2	0.8	grateful
0.8	0	the
0.9	0.7	relief
0.9	0.1	from
0.2	0.4	this
0.9	0.5	unnatural
0.5	0.5	hallucination
0.3	0.1	of
0.5	0.7	the
0.4	0.7	night,
0.6	0	and
0.4	0.5	the
0.1	0.1	fatal
0.7	0.3	contingency
0.1	0.5	of
0.2	0.7	being
0.4	0.7	brought
0.7	0.1	by
0.8	0.3	the

0.4	0.5	
0.9	0.2	Look
0.6	0.6	not
0	0.5	too
0.4	0.7	long
0.7	0	in
0.8	0.5	the
0.4	1	face
0.5	0.3	of
0.8	0.3	the
0.7	1	fire,
0.2	0	O
0.8	1	man!
1	0.2	
0.9	0.8	Never
0.8	0.1	dream
0.8	0.3	with

0.2	0.7	
0.3	1	Turn
0.5	0.2	not
0.8	0.9	thy
0.3	0.6	back
0.4	0.6	to
0.4	0.4	the

0.1	0	accept
0.4	0.8	the
0.3	0.4	first
0	0.2	hint
0.3	0.6	of
0.6	0.8	the
0.2	0.2	hitching
0.1	0.5	tiller;
0.9	0.7	believe
0.6	1	not
0.8	0.4	the
0.6	0.9	artificial
0.2	0.5	fire,
0.8	0.9	when
0.8	0.6	its
0	0.2	redness
0.4	0.8	makes
0.9	0.8	all
0	0.8	things
0.6	0.4	look
0.5	0.3	ghastly.
0.4	0.8	
0.2	0.5	To-morrow,
0.5	0.4	in
0.6	0.6	the
0.4	0.2	natural
0.1	0.1	sun,
0.9	0.9	the
0.3	0.6	skies
0.4	0.2	will
0.7	0	be

0.8	0.9	those

0.8	0.6	like
0.8	0.2	devils
0	0.4	in
0.8	0.5	the
0.8	0.3	forking
0.8	0.5	flames,
0.3	0.4	the
0.8	0.3	morn
0.5	0.2	will
0.6	0.4	show
0.8	0.6	in
0.7	0.1	far
0.8	0.1	other,
0.2	0.7	at
0.5	0.4	least
0.1	0.4	gentler,
0.7	0.8	relief;
0.7	0.1	the

0.3	0.3	golden,
0.9	0	glad
0.2	1	sun,
0.8	0	the

0.4	0.9	others
0.3	0.2	but
0.1	0.8	liars!
0.8	0.8	
1	0.7	Nevertheless
0.3	0.6	the
0.3	0.2	sun
0.5	0.8	hides
0.1	0.3	not
0.3	0	Virginia's
0.8	0.2	Dismal

0.8	0.1	nor
0.8	0.8	Rome's

0.2	0.4	nor
0.7	0.3	wide

0.3	0.2	
0.8	0.9	The

0.2	0	hides
0.6	0.7	not
0.3	0.1	the

0.3	0.9	
0.9	0.5	So,

0.2	0.4	that

0.6	0.7	
0.7	0.8	With

0	0.8	
0.6	0.1	But
0.6	0.5	here
0.9	0.1	a
0.1	0.3	curious
0.6	0.3	difficulty
0.9	0.3	presented
0.1	0.2	itself.
0.7	0.9	
0.4	0.7	In
0.5	0.5	the

0.4	0.3	of
0.4	1	the

0.7	0.8	Ahab
0.2	0.5	had
0.1	0.2	forgotten

0.4	0.2	his

0.5	0.2	and
0.9	1	then
1	0.9	it
0.5	0.5	was

0.3	0.1	by
0.3	0.4	an
0.7	0.3	ingenious
0.8	0.5	and
0.4	1	very
0.5	0.1	handy
0.3	0.6	mechanical
0.1	0.9	contrivance
0.4	0.2	peculiar
0.9	0.2	to
0.2	0.7	the
0.3	0.8	Pequod,
0.1	0.4	and
0.4	0.8	a
0.2	0.1	thing
0.4	0	not

0.7	0.7	rigged

0.8	0.1	vessel
0.5	0.1	at
0.7	0.9	a
0.8	0.2	moment's
0.7	0.8	warning.
0.1	0.4	
0.4	0.7	Now,
0.3	0.1	it
0.6	0.1	is
0.1	0.3	no
0.8	0.4	very
0.7	0.4	easy
0.1	0.1	matter
0.8	0.1	for
0.2	0	anybody--except
0.1	0.1	those
0.3	0.7	who
0	0.9	are
0.8	0.1	almost
0.4	0.5	hourly
0.9	0.9	used
0.5	0.8	to
0.8	0.3	it,
0.1	0	like
0.5	0.5	whalemen--to
0.1	0.5	clamber
0.7	0.5	up
0.4	0.1	a
0.9	0.3	ship's
0.8	0.4	side
0.8	0	from
0.8	0	a
0.1	0.2	boat
0.1	0.6	on

0.9	0.3	for
0.9	0.5	the

0.6	0.2	swells
0	0.8	now
0.8	0.6	lift
0.2	0.5	the

0.8	0	high
0.6	0.4	up
0.4	0.1	towards
1	0.3	the

0.9	0.1	and
0.3	0	then
0.5	1	instantaneously
0.9	0.3	drop

0.7	0.8	half
0	0.8	way
0.8	0.4	down
0.4	0	to
0.7	0.4	the
0.6	0.5	kelson.
0.1	0.5	
0.1	0.9	So,
0.6	0.5	deprived
0.3	0.9	of
0.1	0.9	one
0.8	0.2	leg,
0.2	1	and
0.9	0.9	the
0.9	0.1	strange
0.1	0.2	ship
0	0.2	of
0.6	0.9	course
0	0.6	being
0.8	0.7	altogether
0.2	0.3	unsupplied
0.8	0.5	with
0.5	0.6	the
0.7	0.7	kindly
0.1	0.6	invention,
0.6	0.6	Ahab
0.6	0.1	now
0.8	0.3	found
0	0.3	himself
0.2	0.7	abjectly
0.5	0.8	reduced
0	1	to
0.6	0.8	a
0.3	0.9	clumsy
0.9	0.2	landsman
0.7	0.9	again;
0.8	0.5	hopelessly
0.3	0.1	eyeing
0.6	0.6	the
0.7	0.9	uncertain
0.9	0.4	changeful
0.4	0.1	height
0.3	0.6	he
0.6	0.5	could
0.9	0.8	hardly
0.7	0.7	hope
0.9	0.3	to
1	0.1	attain.
0	0.4	
0	0.1	It
0.2	0.9	has
0.3	0.9	before
0.3	0.2	been
0.5	0	hinted,
0.7	0.5	perhaps,
0.8	0.5	that
0.6	0.6	every
0.2	0.1	little
0.2	0.9	untoward
0.7	0.8	circumstance
0.5	0.1	that
0.6	0.2	befell
0.6	0.7	him,
0.5	1	and
0.9	0.2	which
0.6	0.2	indirectly
0.3	0.5	sprang
0.3	0.5	from
0.5	0.9	his
0.4	0.3	luckless
0.7	0	mishap,
0.2	0.2	almost
0.1	0.9	invariably
0.5	0.2	irritated
0.3	1	or
0.8	0.5	exasperated
0.6	0.5	Ahab.
0.1	0.3	And
0.4	0.8	in
0.6	0.6	the
0.7	0.7	present
0.8	0.5	instance,
0.1	0.3	all
0.2	0.2	this
0.8	0.2	was
0.6	0.7	heightened
0.2	0.5	by
0.5	0.7	the
0.4	0.8	sight
0.2	0.4	of
1	0.9	the
0.4	0.3	two
0.3	0.8	officers
0.1	0.5	of
0.1	0.3	the
0.9	0.8	strange
0.7	0.7	ship,
0.5	0.9	leaning
0.8	0.9	over
0.4	0.8	the
0.1	0.8	side,
0.2	0.3	by
0	0.2	the
0.8	0.1	perpendicular
0.2	0.9	ladder
0.9	0.5	of
0.3	0.3	nailed
0.6	0	cleets
0.2	0.8	there,
0	0.3	and
0.9	0.8	swinging
0.6	0.7	towards
0.1	0.3	him
0.1	0.4	a
0.2	0.5	pair
1	0.9	of
0.4	0	tastefully-ornamented
0.7	0.2	man-ropes;
0.8	0.7	for
0.7	0.1	at
0.2	0.8	first
0.4	0.9	they
0.5	0.1	did
0.1	0.1	not
0.2	0.4	seem
0.8	0	to
0.7	0.3	bethink
0.6	0.4	them
0.9	0.6	that
0.1	0.4	a
0.7	0.2	one-legged
0.4	0.1	man
0.8	0.1	must
0.9	0.1	be
0.9	0.2	too
0.1	1	much
0.2	0.4	of
0.5	0.9	a
0.3	0.4	cripple
0.9	0.4	to

0.3	0.2	their
0.9	0.2	sea
0.5	0.8	bannisters.
0.2	0.8	
0.9	0.6	But
0.5	0.6	this
0.5	0.3	awkwardness
0.6	0.9	only
0.8	0.4	lasted
0.3	0.8	a
1	0.9	minute,
0	0.3	because
0.8	0.5	the
0.6	0.5	strange
0.7	0.9	captain,
0.6	0.1	observing
0.6	0.9	at
0.3	0.9	a
0.8	0.2	glance
0.8	0.9	how
0.9	0.4	affairs
0.3	0.2	stood,
0.7	0.9	cried
0.1	0.2	out,
0.1	0.6	"I
0.5	0.2	see,

0.8	0.8	see!--avast

0.9	0.1	
0.3	0.9	As
0.2	0.9	good
0.1	0.8	luck
0.1	0.4	would
0	0.3	have
0.8	0	it,
0.6	0.7	they
0.6	0.3	had
0.1	0.4	had
0.4	0.3	a
0.1	0.2	whale
0.3	0.2	alongside
0.5	0.1	a
0.8	0.7	day
0.1	0.6	or
0.9	0.3	two
0.2	1	previous,
0.2	0.1	and
0.2	0.6	the
0.6	1	great
0.1	0.4	tackles
0.7	1	were
0.6	0.4	still
0.7	0.5	aloft,
0.6	0.5	and
0.5	0	the
0	0.9	massive
0	0.4	curved
0.1	0.7	blubber-hook,
0.2	0.8	now
0.2	0.8	clean
0.7	0.9	and
0.9	0.8	dry,
0.4	0.7	was
0.5	0.2	still

0.1	0.3	to
0.9	0.6	the

1	0.7	
0.6	0.4	This
0.2	0.6	was
0.5	0.6	quickly
0.3	0.2	lowered
0.8	0.7	to
0.7	0.4	Ahab,
0.5	0.4	who
0.5	0.3	at
0.4	0.8	once
0.6	0.8	comprehending
0.2	0.7	it
0.6	0.3	all,

1	0.3	of
0.6	0.8	the

0.7	1	(it
0.2	0.7	was

0.4	0.1	of

0.8	1	and
0.6	0.1	then
0.6	0.5	giving
0.8	0.2	the
0.8	1	word,
1	0.9	held
0.1	0.7	himself
0.4	0.1	fast,
0.3	0.9	and
0.5	0.4	at
0.9	0.6	the
0.6	0.7	same
0.8	0.6	time
0.8	0.3	also
0.3	0	helped

1	0.8	
0.6	0.9	The
0.7	0.7	beef

0.9	0.7	fine--tough,
0.7	0.1	but
0.2	0.7	with
0.8	0.9	body
0.7	0.4	in
0.6	0.7	it.
0.5	0.4	
0.9	0.1	They

0.6	0.8	it
0.6	0.8	was
0.3	0.6	bull-beef;
0.6	0	others,
0.8	0.6	that
0.2	0.6	it
0.7	0.4	was
0.8	0.3	dromedary
0.6	0.2	beef;
0.1	0.2	but
1	0.4	I
1	0.9	do
0.6	0.4	not
0.1	0.8	know,
0.6	0.5	for
0.5	0.9	certain,
0.7	0.3	how
0.2	0.7	that
0.8	0.3	was.
0.7	0.4	
0.1	0.3	They
0.8	0.5	had
0.2	0.7	dumplings
0.7	0.7	too;
0.5	0.6	small,
0.3	0.9	but
0.3	0.3	substantial,
0.5	0.1	symmetrically
0	0.5	globular,
0.8	1	and
0.9	0.4	indestructible
1	0.6	dumplings.
0.1	0.6	
0.1	0.8	I
0.8	0.8	fancied
0.1	0.1	that
0.3	0.3	you

0.1	0.1	feel
0.5	0.3	them,
0.9	0.3	and
0.9	0.7	roll

0.7	0.1	you
0.6	0.1	after
0.4	0.1	they
0.6	0.9	were
0.8	0.7	swallowed.
0.1	0.1	
0.7	0.4	If
0.7	0.5	you
0.6	0.4	stooped
0.4	0.8	over
0.1	0.4	too
0	0.5	far
0.8	0	forward,
0.8	0.1	you
0.5	0.5	risked
0.7	0.4	their
0.4	0.1	pitching
0.8	0.9	out
0.3	0.5	of
0.1	0.6	you
0.7	0.8	like

0.8	0.8	
0.8	0.7	The
0.4	0.4	bread--but
0.3	0.3	that
0.9	0.1	couldn't
0.7	0.4	be
0	0.8	helped;
0.9	0.5	besides,
0.3	0.1	it
0.5	0.2	was
0.3	0.5	an

0.8	0.4	in
0.1	0.7	short,
0.6	0.8	the

0.1	0.7	contained
0.2	0.8	the

0	0.8	they
0.6	0.5	had.
0.5	0.2	
0.4	0.4	But
0.2	0.7	the
0.8	0.3	forecastle
0.7	0.2	was
0.2	0.2	not
0.7	0.3	very
0.3	0.5	light,
0.3	0.9	and
0	0.7	it
0.5	0.8	was
1	0.1	very
0.7	0	easy
0.7	0.2	to
0.4	0.4	step
0.9	0.1	over
0.5	0	into
0.7	0.7	a

0.4	0.3	corner
0.6	0.7	when
0.8	0.6	you
1	0	ate

0.2	0.5	
0.3	1	But
0.6	0.1	all

1	0.4	say,
0.3	1	the
0.3	0.5	Samuel
0.3	0.1	Enderby
0	0.5	was
0.2	0.7	a

0.3	0.2	
0.3	0.8	But
0.2	0.9	why

0.5	0.9	it,

0.9	0.1	
0.9	0.2	I

0.7	0.4	
0.7	0.3	The

0.3	0.2	good

0.3	0.1	of
0	0.8	these

0.5	0.3	
0.5	0.4	Nor

0.8	0.3	
0.3	0.8	The

0.9	0.1	
0.5	0.6	For,

0.3	0.6	
0.4	0.5	Hence,

1	0.1	of

0.8	0.6	incidental
0.8	0.1	and

0.4	0.3	and,
0.1	0.7	therefore,

1	0.6	which

0.9	0.1	During

0.2	0.1	in

0.6	0.3	
0.8	0.3	The

0.4	0.7	"Dan

0.7	0.2	wherefore
0.4	0	I
0.5	0.5	concluded
0.7	0.4	that
0.5	0.3	this

0.5	0.8	in
0.7	0.2	this

0.6	0	by

0.6	0.9	At

0.5	0.7	Platonic
0.7	0.1	application;
0.3	1	and,
0.6	0.6	furthermore,
0.3	1	I

0.6	0.5	of

0.1	0.8	
1	0.5	In

0.3	0.4	still
0.9	0.8	more
0.5	0.9	unctuous

0.9	0.2	therefore,
0.3	0.3	I
1	0.8	say,
0.8	0.1	we
0.2	0.5	have
0.7	0.8	precisely
0.6	0.1	two

0.2	0.8	this

0.1	0.9	seem
0.3	0.4	somewhat

0.8	0.6	
0.8	0.6	Yet
1	0.8	they

0.9	0.9	hit
0.5	0.7	them
0.2	0.4	too.
0.8	0.9	
0.1	0.2	But
0.9	0.8	this

0.4	0.6	Yet,

1	0.9	
0.9	0	Now,
0.2	0.3	when
0.5	0.5	with
1	0.7	royal
0.1	0.6	Tranquo
0	0.7	I
0.5	0.5	visited
0.4	0.2	this
1	0.3	wondrous
0.8	0.9	whale,
0.7	0.8	and
0.3	0.5	saw
0.7	0.4	the

0.1	0.4	an
0.5	0.9	altar,
0.2	0.6	and
0.9	0.4	the

0.7	0.1	ascending
0.7	0.3	from

0.4	0.6	jet
0.8	0	had
0.8	0.3	issued,
0.6	0.2	I
0.6	0.2	marvelled
0.1	0.3	that
0.6	0.8	the
0.8	0.7	king
0.1	0.9	should
0.3	0.4	regard
0.9	0.1	a

0.8	0.2	object
0.4	0.1	of
0.7	0.1	vertu.
0.7	0.2	
0.1	0.9	He
0.3	0.7	laughed.
0.9	0.2	
0.8	0	But
0.7	0.1	more
0.2	0.8	I
0.6	1	marvelled
0.5	0.6	that
0.1	0.1	the
0.6	0.5	priests
0.5	0.4	should
0.1	0.6	swear
0.8	0.3	that
0.6	0.7	smoky
0.2	0.6	jet
0.3	0.8	of
0.1	0.4	his
1	0.6	was
0.3	0	genuine.
0.6	0.8	
0.9	0.8	To
0.2	0.7	and
0.6	0.6	fro
0.6	0.7	I
0.6	0.6	paced
0.4	0.1	before
0.1	0.2	this
0.7	0.8	skeleton--brushed
0.6	0.8	the
1	0.1	vines
0.5	0.1	aside--broke
0.8	1	through
0.6	0.2	the
0.4	0	ribs--and
0.4	0	with
0.5	0.4	a
0.1	0.2	ball
0.8	0.8	of
0.1	0.8	Arsacidean
0.5	0.5	twine,
0.1	0.2	wandered,
1	0.2	eddied
0.2	0.1	long
0.5	0.9	amid
0.2	0.2	its
0.1	0.9	many
0.5	0.2	winding,
1	0.1	shaded
0.4	0.4	colonnades
0.2	0.6	and
0.5	0.5	arbours.
1	0.7	
0.6	0.2	But
0.1	0.8	soon
0	0.4	my
0.8	1	line
0.1	0.4	was
0.8	0.2	out;
0.5	0.2	and
0	0.5	following
0.3	0.2	it
0.1	0.6	back,
0.8	0.6	I
0.9	0.9	emerged
0.2	0.8	from
0.9	0.6	the
0.3	0.6	opening
0.4	0.5	where
0	0.3	I
0.3	0.3	entered.
0.3	0.1	
0.5	0.4	I
0.9	0.4	saw
0.8	0.9	no
0.5	0.1	living
0.8	0.1	thing
0.3	0.9	within;
0.7	0.7	naught
0.5	0.1	was
0.6	0.4	there
0.9	0.6	but
0.3	0.1	bones.
0.9	0.6	
0.6	0.7	Cutting
0.7	0.3	me
1	0.3	a
0.3	0.9	green
0.8	0.8	measuring-rod,
0.4	0.2	I
0.4	0.7	once
0.9	0.1	more
0.7	0.3	dived
0	0.3	within
0.3	0.7	the
0.9	0.5	skeleton.
0.8	0.9	
1	0.1	From
0.7	0.9	their
0.8	0.2	arrow-slit
0.2	0.6	in
0.7	0.4	the
0	0.8	skull,
0.9	0.5	the
0.5	0.7	priests
0.5	0.9	perceived
0.9	0.4	me
0.2	1	taking
0.4	0.9	the
0.2	0.1	altitude
0.1	0.9	of
0.3	1	the
0.2	0.7	final
0.7	0.3	rib,
0.6	0.3	"How
0	0.4	now!"
0.7	0.7	they
0.9	0.9	shouted;
0	0.3	"Dar'st
0.4	0.8	thou
0.5	0	measure
0.8	0.9	this
0.2	0.3	our
0.4	0.4	god!
0.1	0.7	
0.4	0.9	That's
0.6	0.4	for

0.7	0.2	
0.1	0	"Aye,
0.8	0.6	priests--well,
0.3	0.9	how
0	0.3	long
0.5	0.1	do
0.3	0.3	ye
0.5	0.1	make
0.6	0.1	him,
0.2	0.3	then?"
0.6	0.6	
0.8	0.2	But
0.2	0.1	hereupon
0.7	0.7	a
0.9	0.8	fierce
0.9	0.1	contest
0.9	0.4	rose
0.1	0.5	among
0.9	0.9	them,
0.2	0.5	concerning
1	0.7	feet
0.6	0.4	and
0.1	0.7	inches;
1	0.1	they
0.8	0.8	cracked
0.1	0.8	each
0.1	0.3	other's
0.2	0.4	sconces
0.1	0.1	with
0.1	0.9	their
0.9	0.5	yard-sticks--the
0.7	0.7	great
0.3	0	skull
0.7	0.3	echoed--and
0.7	0.8	seizing
0.6	0.7	that
0.4	0.6	lucky
0.5	0.7	chance,
0.9	0.7	I
0.4	0.3	quickly
0.8	0.4	concluded
0.2	0.9	my
0.9	0.9	own
0.3	0.7	admeasurements.
1	0.3	
0.7	0.9	These
0.3	0.6	admeasurements
0.7	0.9	I
0.6	0.2	now
0.5	0	propose

0.1	0.2	
1	0.6	But

0.3	0.1	please.
0.4	0.6	
0.4	0.9	Because

0.2	0.4	But
0.9	0.2	now
0.9	0.7	it's
0.8	0.2	done,
0.5	0.4	it
0.7	0.8	looks

0.5	0.4	
0.1	0.4	There

0.5	0.7	more
1	0.2	than
0.9	0.6	four.
0	0.1	
0.2	0.6	The

0.1	0.6	into

0.8	0.9	inches
0.3	1	in

0.4	0.9	and
0.3	0.7	looks
0.8	0	something
0.2	0.3	like
0.8	0.3	a
0.2	0.2	white
0.2	0.7	billiard-ball.
0.4	0.3	
0.7	0.6	I
1	0.6	was
0.4	0.3	told

0.8	0	had

0.8	0.6	
0.5	0.4	You

0.1	0.6	or
0.8	0.3	by
0.7	0.8	instinct,
0.9	0.3	or
0.4	0.5	simply
0.6	0.3	because
0.8	0.6	he

0.1	0.6	by

0.5	0.5	of

0.9	0.5	
0.9	0.4	He
0.7	0.1	was

0.3	0.6	ever
0.7	0.8	had

0.9	0.6	
0.5	0.1	He

0.3	0.4	of
0.1	0.3	those
0.4	0.8	unreasoning
0.5	0.1	but
0.2	0.3	still
0.1	0	highly
0.5	0.9	useful,
0.8	0.6	MULTUM

0.3	0.2	of

0.1	0.4	So,

0.3	0.9	take

0.9	0.1	
1	0.2	Yet,

0.9	0.5	this

0.5	0.5	open-and-shut

0.8	0.3

0.2	0.2	something
0.6	0.7	that
0.5	0.2	somehow

0.8	0.8	did

0.5	0.1	
0.2	0.1	What
0.4	0.8	that

0.4	0.9	whether

0.2	0.4	
0.3	0.5	And
0.8	0.8	this

0.3	0.5	impatient
0.8	0.5	for

0.3	0.9	
0.3	0.2	In
0.4	0.4	good
0	1	time
1	0.6	the
0.5	0.1	order
0.6	0.7	came.
0.3	0.4	It
0.3	0.1	was
0.9	0.6	hard
0.6	0.1	upon
0.6	0.4	high
0.2	0.3	noon;
0.4	0.2	and
0.2	0.1	Ahab,
0.8	0.3	seated
1	0.9	in

0.2	0.9	of
0	0.4	his
0.6	0.9	high-hoisted
0.5	0.4	boat,
0.6	0.2	was

0.6	0.2	observation
0.3	0.4	of

0.9	0.1	to
0.7	0.6	determine
0.2	0.7	his
0.4	0.4	latitude.
0.5	0.2	
0.3	0.4	Now,
0.9	0.9	in
0.9	0.4	that
0.7	0.8	Japanese
0.2	0.7	sea,
0.4	0.5	the
0.6	0.6	days
0.2	0.9	in

0.7	0.9	are

0.5	0.3	
0.4	0.2	That
0.2	0.4	unblinkingly
0.3	0.5	vivid
0.8	0	Japanese
0.3	0.6	sun
0.3	0.8	seems
0.2	0.1	the

1	0.5	of
0	0.8	the
0.3	0.6	glassy
0.7	0.2	ocean's
0.6	0.8	immeasurable
0.4	0.8	burning-glass.
0.6	0.5	
0.2	0.9	The
0.4	0.2	sky
0.3	0.2	looks
0.3	0.5	lacquered;
0.5	0.7	clouds
0.3	0.8	there
0.6	0.5	are
0.4	0.8	none;
0.7	0.8	the
0.5	0.1	horizon
0.5	0.1	floats;
0.1	0.3	and
0.1	0.3	this
0.1	0.4	nakedness
0.5	0.7	of
0	0.8	unrelieved
0.5	1	radiance
0.2	0.5	is
0.9	0.3	as
0.9	0.7	the

0.3	0.8	of

0.9	0.2	
0.5	0.7	Well
0.8	0.8	that
0.7	0.6	Ahab's
0.1	0.9	quadrant
0.6	0.6	was

0.4	0.6	glasses,
0.8	0.6	through
0.9	0.5	which
1	0.8	to

0.4	0.4	
0	0.9	So,
0.8	0	swinging
0.8	0.9	his
0.8	0.2	seated
1	0.4	form
0.5	0.4	to
0.2	0.6	the
0.9	0.8	roll
0.1	0.6	of
0.4	0.1	the
0.6	0.9	ship,
0.7	0.7	and
0.8	0.3	with
1	0.5	his
0.9	0.3	astrological-looking
0.2	0.8	instrument
0.9	1	placed
0.8	0.2	to
0.1	0.4	his
0.6	0.2	eye,
0.8	0.1	he
0.1	0.2	remained
0.1	0.7	in
0.1	0.3	that

0.7	0.8	for
0.1	0.5	some
0.7	0.3	moments
0.6	0.8	to
0.8	0.9	catch
0	0.2	the
0.2	0.1	precise
0.2	0.4	instant
0.5	0.1	when
0.8	0.5	the

0.9	0.2	
0.1	0.4	Meantime
0.1	0.8	while
0.3	0.2	his
0.7	0.6	whole

0.6	1	was
0.4	0.1	absorbed,
0	0.2	the

0.2	0	and
0.7	1	with
0.8	0.2	face
0.6	0.5	thrown
0.8	0.9	up
1	0.7	like
0.2	0.7	Ahab's,
0.1	0.7	was
0.8	0.6	eyeing
0.7	0.8	the
0.6	0.5	same
0.4	0.5	sun
0	0.2	with
0.3	0.5	him;
0.4	0.6	only
0.4	0.1	the

0.6	0.9	of
0.4	0.1	his
0.4	0.6	eyes
0.4	0.3	half
0.6	0.8	hooded
0.3	0.8	their
0.9	0.1	orbs,
0.5	0.5	and
0	0.6	his
0.7	0.4	wild
0.4	0.5	face
0.8	0.7	was
0.2	0.2	subdued
0.8	0.3	to
0.8	0.7	an
1	0	earthly
0.1	0.8	passionlessness.
0.7	0.4	
0.6	0.1	At
1	0.6	length
0.8	0.4	the
0.8	0.7	desired
0.1	0.1	observation
0	0.7	was
0.5	0.9	taken;
0.1	0.7	and
0	0	with
0.2	0.1	his
0.3	0.8	pencil
0	0.8	upon
0.3	0.5	his
0	0.2	ivory
0.3	0.8	leg,
0.5	0.9	Ahab
0.5	0	soon
0.4	0.2	calculated
0.5	0.5	what

0.3	0.8	
0.1	0.4	Then
0.8	1	falling
0.8	0.1	into
0.4	0.5	a
0.7	0.1	moment's
0.3	0	revery,
0.5	0.5	he
0.1	0.8	again
0.7	0.4	looked

0.5	0.3	towards
0.3	0	the

0.5	0.7	and
0.4	0	murmured

0.2	0.8	some

0.4	0.1	
0.2	0.6	Though
0.7	0.2	such

0.2	0.9	
0.5	0.3	If

0.1	0.5	by

0.8	0.8	both,
0.4	0.2	so
0.8	0.5	far
0.9	0.8	as
0.2	0.7	concerned
0.9	0.5	the

0.8	1	interchange.
0.2	0.3	At
0.8	0.3	times,
0.6	0.4	for

0.7	0.9	hours,
0	0.5	without
0.7	0.1	a
0.6	0.5	single
0.3	0.3	hail,
0.9	0.8	they
0.8	0.8	stood
0.4	0.2	far
0.1	0.9	parted

0.8	0.1	other;
0.9	0.4	as

0.1	0.7	Ahab
0.9	0.7	saw

0.6	0.5	
0.3	0	And
0.1	0.7	yet,
0.3	0.8	somehow,
0.6	0.7	did
0.3	1	Ahab--in

0.6	0.7	proper
0.2	1	self,
0	0.1	as
0.4	0.3	daily,

0.9	0.1	commandingly
0.5	0.7	revealed
0.3	0.8	to
0	0.9	his
0.6	0.3	subordinates,--Ahab
0.4	0.9	seemed
0	0	an

0.2	0.1	lord;
0.8	0.7	the
0.3	0.7	Parsee
1	0.8	but

0.3	0.6	
0.8	0.1	Still
0.6	0.3	again
0.7	0.9	both
0.1	1	seemed

0.1	0.2	faintest
0.1	0.9	glimmering
0.9	0.9	of

1	0.5	his
0.1	0.8	iron
0.6	0.4	voice
0.1	0.8	was
0.1	0.3	heard
0.5	0.4	from
0.5	0.2	aft,--"Man

0.8	1	all
0.8	0.1	through

0.7	0.2	till
0.3	0.3	after

0.4	0.2	
0.5	0.1	But
0.2	0.5	when

0.9	0.6	the
0.5	0.2	monomaniac
0.5	0.4	old

0.3	0	seemed
0.4	0.1	distrustful

0	0.5	all
0.3	1	except
0.4	0.7	the
0.5	0.6	Pagan

0.2	0.7	he

0.3	0.3	whether
0.4	0.6	Stubb

0.5	0.2	So

0.1	0.9	strange
0.4	0.8	thing
0.6	0.2	about
0.8	0	them

0.4	0.1	be,
0	0.9	that
0.9	0.3	Starbuck,
0.9	0.8	almost
0.7	0.9	the
0.9	0.3	one
0.2	0.3	only
0.7	0.3	man
0.1	0.6	who
0.8	0.9	had

0.7	0.3	of

0.8	0.7	too,
0.5	0.8	whose
0.4	0.4	faithfulness
0.9	0.8	on
0.8	0.8	the
0.1	0.6	look-out
0.6	0.5	he
0.6	0.7	had
0.8	0.3	seemed
0.4	0.1	to
0.1	0.1	doubt
0.1	0.5	somewhat;--it
0.4	0.8	was
0.1	0.5	strange,
0.7	0.3	that
0.5	0.3	this
0.2	0.9	was
0.7	0.5	the
0.6	0.5	very
0.1	0.8	man
0.5	0.8	he
0.7	0.9	should
0.3	0.1	select
0.3	0.6	for
0.5	0	his
0.9	0.6	watchman;
0.7	0.7	freely
0.7	0.5	giving
0.7	0.7	his
0	0	whole
0.6	0.2	life
1	0.4	into
0.7	0.1	such
0.5	0.4	an
0.7	0.5	otherwise
0.9	0.8	distrusted
0.2	0.3	person's
0.7	0.9	hands.
0.6	0.2	
0.5	0.9	Now,
0.2	0.5	the
0.7	0.1	first
0.9	0.6	time
0.6	0.2	Ahab
0.2	0.5	was
0.6	0.4	perched
0.6	0.2	aloft;
0.2	0.1	ere
1	0.7	he
1	0.1	had
0.9	0.5	been
0.8	0.2	there
0.1	0.6	ten
0.4	0.3	minutes;
0.6	0.4	one
1	0.9	of
0.8	0.2	those
0.8	0.9	red-billed
0.2	0.7	savage
0.8	0.5	sea-hawks
0.3	0.6	which
0.9	0.7	so
0.5	0.2	often
0.8	0.5	fly
0.2	0.1	incommodiously
0.3	0.1	close
0.8	0.1	round
0.1	0.3	the
0.1	0.1	manned
0.1	0.9	mast-heads
0.5	0.5	of
0.2	0.6	whalemen
0.5	0.6	in
0.8	0.4	these
0.7	0.6	latitudes;
0.8	0.4	one
0.1	0.1	of
0.9	0.2	these
0.4	0.4	birds
0.2	0.2	came
0.3	0.3	wheeling
0.9	0.4	and
1	0.6	screaming
0.6	0.9	round
0.7	0.3	his
0.3	0.2	head
0.7	0.1	in
0.7	0.1	a
0.6	0.2	maze
0.6	0.2	of
0	0.2	untrackably
0.3	0.3	swift
0.9	0	circlings.
0.1	0.6	
1	0.7	Then
0.6	0.2	it
0.8	0.4	darted
0.4	0.2	a
1	0.3	thousand
0.1	0.1	feet
0.6	0.3	straight
0.8	0.4	up
0.9	0.9	into
0.5	0.6	the
0.1	0.4	air;
0	0.8	then
0.7	1	spiralized
0.8	0.3	downwards,
0.7	0.2	and
0.8	0.6	went
0.7	0.1	eddying
0.2	0.8	again
0.3	0.5	round
0.5	0.1	his
0.9	0.1	head.
0.2	0.1	
0.9	0.4	But
0.5	0.1	with
0.1	0.6	his
0.6	0.7	gaze
0.6	0.2	fixed
0.8	0.9	upon
0.4	0.9	the
0.9	0.5	dim
0.7	1	and
0.4	0.1	distant
0.5	0.2	horizon,
0.5	0.4	Ahab
0.9	0.3	seemed
0	0.7	not
0.6	0.4	to
0.3	0.7	mark
0.1	0.8	this
0.2	0.9	wild
0.2	0.9	bird;
0.7	0.2	nor,
0.7	0.2	indeed,
0.9	0.4	would
0.9	0.9	any
0.1	0.2	one
0.9	0.2	else
0.9	0.4	have
0.5	0.3	marked
0.6	0.1	it
0.8	0.2	much,
0.3	0.6	it
0.5	1	being
0.4	0.8	no
0.8	0.5	uncommon
0.1	0.5	circumstance;
0.7	0.9	only
0	0.1	now
0.8	0.4	almost
0.3	0.6	the
0.6	0.7	least
0.1	0.4	heedful
0.9	0.4	eye
0.3	0.7	seemed
0.9	0.2	to
0.6	0.5	see
0.4	0.1	some
0.3	0.6	sort
0.5	0.8	of
0.4	0.7	cunning
0.4	0.6	meaning
0.5	0.9	in
0.5	0.6	almost
0.5	0.7	every

0.4	0.5	
0.3	0.7	"Your
0	0.4	hat,
0.9	0.4	your
0.2	0.2	hat,
0.2	1	sir!"
0.7	0.5	suddenly
0.2	0.4	cried
0.2	0.6	the
0.9	0.6	Sicilian
0.6	0.1	seaman,
0.6	0.3	who
0.8	0.8	being
0	0.2	posted
0	0.4	at
0.8	0.1	the
0.4	0.8	mizen-mast-head,
0.2	0.2	stood
0.5	0.8	directly
0.8	0.3	behind
0.6	0.7	Ahab,
0.2	0.7	though
0.2	0.4	somewhat
0.7	0.8	lower
0	0.1	than
0.6	0.7	his
0.5	0.8	level,
0.3	0.4	and
0.9	0.3	with
0.6	0.5	a
0.3	0.8	deep
0.9	0.4	gulf
0.9	0.3	of
0.7	0.4	air
0.7	1	dividing

0.9	0.4	
0.7	0.7	But
0.4	0.2	already
0.8	0.4	the

0.2	1	wing
0.3	0.8	was
0.1	0.3	before
0.1	0.1	the

0.7	0.7	with

0.6	0.3	the
0.1	0.6	black
0	0.7	hawk
0.9	0.1	darted
0.1	0.9	away
0.1	1	with
0.1	0.8	his
0.2	0.2	prize.
0.5	0.3	
1	0.4	An
0.4	0.9	eagle
0.4	0.9	flew
0.6	1	thrice
0.9	0.4	round
0.9	0.9	Tarquin's
0.8	0.2	head,
0.5	0.3	removing
0.8	1	his
0.1	0.4	cap
0.6	1	to
0.9	0.3	replace
0.7	0.9	it,
0.1	0.4	and
0.3	0.3	thereupon
0.1	0.5	Tanaquil,
0.9	0.8	his
0.9	0.5	wife,
0.9	0.4	declared
0.5	0.8	that

0.4	0.7	king
0.1	0.9	of

0.1	0.8	
0.6	0.1	But

0.2	0.4	till

0.1	0.6	turned,
0.5	0.1	and
0.7	0.1	then
0.8	1	there
0.2	0.5	were
0.5	0.6	plainly

0.6	0.6	
1	0	The

0.3	0.7	yawned
0.1	0.7	beneath

0.2	0.6	Then,
