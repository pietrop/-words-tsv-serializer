0.5	0.9	As
0.1	0.4	hard
0.5	0.8	as
0.5	0.2	it
0.3	0.8	is
0.7	0.6	to

0.3	0.8	it's
0.2	0.3	possible

0.8	0.2	Because

0.6	0.4	one
0.8	0.1	of

0.6	0.8	ways.
0.1	0.7	Although
0.5	0.7	these
0.6	0.4	four
1	0.2	corporations
0.7	0.1	differ
0.4	0.3	in
0.9	0.2	important
0.7	0.1	and
0.5	0.5	meaningful
0.5	0	ways,
0.3	0.5	we've
0.4	0.7	observed
0.3	0.7	common
0.6	0.6	patterns
0.5	0.4	and
0.8	0.6	competition
0.2	0.3	problems
0.3	1	over
0	0.3	the
0.5	0.1	course
0.9	0.8	of
0.3	0.4	this
0	0.2	investigation.
0.6	0.4	First,
0.8	0.2	each
0.6	0.6	platform
1	0.8	is
0.3	0.4	a
0.6	0.7	bottleneck
0.7	0.1	for
0.7	0.3	a
0.3	0.1	key
0.5	0.2	channel
0.8	0.6	of
0.8	0.5	distribution.
0.1	0.8	Whether
0.6	0.9	they
0	0.1	can
0.6	0.3	control
0.4	1	access
0.4	0.2	to
0.3	0.3	information
0.3	0.8	or
0.4	0.6	to
0.9	0	the
0.7	0.1	marketplace,
0.3	0.6	these
0.8	0.6	platforms
0.2	0.9	have
0.6	0.2	the
0.9	0.7	incentive
0	0.7	and
0.8	0.4	ability
0.6	0.3	to
0.6	0.9	exploit
0.1	0.5	this
0.3	0.7	power.
0.1	0.9	They
0.1	0.9	can
0.7	0.6	charge
0.7	0.5	exorbitant
0.2	0.1	fees,
0.1	0.7	impose
0.9	0.9	oppressive
0.6	0.1	contracts,
0.4	0.9	and
0.4	0.1	extract
0.1	0.6	valuable
0.9	0.3	data
0.7	1	from
0.9	0.2	the
0.9	0.9	people
0.3	0.7	and
0.7	0.2	businesses
0.1	0.5	that
0.4	0.8	rely
0.1	0.3	on
0.6	0.2	them.
0.9	0.9	Second,
0.3	0	each
0.3	0	platform
1	0.9	uses
0.2	0.8	its
0.5	0.6	control
0.3	0.2	over
1	0.3	digital
0.8	0.7	infrastructure
0.5	0.6	to
0.5	0.7	survey
0.2	0.8	all
0.3	0.3	other
0	0.9	companies,
0.6	0.5	their
0.1	0.8	growth,
0.6	0.7	business
0.1	0.6	activity,
0.4	1	and
0.2	0.7	whether
0.1	1	they
0.4	0.6	might--whether
0.9	0.7	they
0.9	0.5	might
0.5	0	pose
0.3	0.8	a
0.7	0	competitive
0.5	0.9	threat.
0.5	0.8	Each
0.4	0.1	platform
0.3	0.7	has
0.3	0.7	used
0.8	0.3	this
0.9	0.6	data
1	0.6	to
0.3	0.3	protect
0.6	0.3	its
0.6	0.4	power
0.4	0.9	by
0	0.7	either
0.1	0.9	buying,
0.5	0.9	copying,
0.9	0.1	or
0.9	0.5	cutting
1	0.4	off
0.8	0.8	access
0.8	0	for
0.8	0.1	any
0.9	0.1	actual
0.4	0	or
0.4	0.6	potential
0.3	0.1	rival.
0.7	0.2	Third,
0.5	0.1	these
0.6	0.9	platforms
0.7	0.8	abuse
0.3	0.4	their
0.9	0.6	control
0.5	0.5	over
0.9	0	current
0.7	0.4	technologies
0.6	0.3	to
0.3	1	extend
0.8	0.6	their
0.6	0.5	power.
0.3	0.6	Whether
0.8	0.4	it's
0.5	0.7	through
0.8	0.2	self-preferencing,
0.5	0.5	predatory
0.7	0.1	pricing,
0.5	0.4	requiring
0.5	0.9	users
0.7	0.6	to
0.4	0.2	buy
0.9	0.9	additional
0.7	0	products,
0.6	0.4	the
0.2	0.6	dominant
0.7	0	platforms
0.5	0.1	have
0.9	0.1	wielded
0.4	0.8	their
0.3	0.2	power
0.5	0.6	in
0.9	0.8	destructive,
0.2	0.7	harmful
0.9	0.6	ways
0.4	0.3	in
0.9	0.4	order
0.7	0	to
1	0.3	expand.
0.9	0.8	At
0.3	0.1	today's
0.2	0.7	hearing
0.3	0.1	we'll
0.5	0.3	examine
0.1	0.1	how
0.8	0.5	each
0.2	0.8	of
0.7	0.8	these
0.2	0.1	companies
0.3	0.9	has
0.2	0.5	used
0.3	0.6	this
0.6	0.4	playbook
0.8	0.8	to
0.5	0.8	achieve
0.8	0.3	and
0.4	0.1	maintain
0.4	0.7	dominance
0.1	0.1	and
0.1	0.1	how
0.7	0.1	their
0.6	0	power
0.9	0.2	shapes
0.7	0.1	that
0.7	1	affects
0.9	0.1	our
0.9	0	daily
0.1	0.1	lives.
0.3	0.8	So,
0.3	0.1	why
0.5	0.6	does
0.7	0.8	this
0.3	0.4	matter?
0.8	0.3	Many
0	0.2	of
0.2	0.4	the
0.1	0.8	practices
0.6	0.1	used
0.1	0.3	by
0.1	1	these
0	0.6	companies
0.3	0.3	have
0.3	0.6	harmful
0.1	0.1	economic
0.3	0.6	effects.
0.2	0.5	They
0.8	0.5	discourage
0.1	0.3	entrepreneurship,
0.3	0.2	destroy
0.5	0.5	jobs,
0.8	0.7	hike
0.5	0	costs,
0.5	0.8	and
0.7	0.8	degrade
0.8	0.4	quality.
0.6	0.4	Simply
0.5	0.8	put,
0.7	0.9	they
0.2	0.6	have
0.8	0.4	too
0.2	0.8	much
0.9	0.7	power.
0.2	0.6	This
0.7	0.3	power
1	0.6	staves
0.2	0	off
0.9	0.5	new
0.9	0.9	forms
0.9	0.8	of
0.2	0.1	competition,
0.5	0.7	creativity,
0.1	0.7	and
0.7	1	innovation.
0.9	0.4	And
0.3	0.6	while
0.5	0.4	these
0.1	0.7	dominant
0.8	0.2	firms
0.4	0.5	may
0	0.5	still
0.8	0.3	produce
0.3	0.5	some
0.2	0.8	new
0.5	1	innovative
0.7	0	products,
0.3	0.9	their
0.5	0.1	dominance
0.7	0.1	is
0.5	0.4	killing
0.1	0.6	small
0	0	businesses,
1	0.2	manufacturing,
0.3	0.4	and
0.8	0.9	overall
0.4	0.5	dynamism
0.3	0.8	that
0.8	0	are
0.4	1	the
0.4	0.7	engines
0.8	0.6	of
0.5	0.2	the
0.3	0.8	American
0.6	0.9	economy.
0.2	0.3	Several
0.9	0.1	of
0	0	these
0.1	0.1	firms
0.6	0.6	also
0.1	0.2	harvested
0.5	0.7	abuse
1	0.9	people's
0.4	0.6	data
0.3	0.4	to
0.7	0.6	sell
0.3	0.9	ads
0.8	0.4	for
0.8	1	everything
0.1	0.2	from
0.4	0.2	new
0.8	0.5	books
1	0.5	to
0.7	0.7	dangerous
0.7	0.5	so-called
0.8	0	miracle
0.4	0.9	cures.
0.8	0.8	When
0.4	0.2	everyday
0.2	0.2	Americans
0.5	0.3	learn
0.1	0	how
0.7	0.8	much
0.1	0.5	of
0.2	0.6	their
0.3	0.8	data
0.8	0.4	is
0.7	0.7	being
0.3	0.4	mined,
0.4	0.8	they
0.4	0.2	can't
0.5	0.3	run
0.1	0.5	away
1	0	fast
0.7	0.5	enough.
0.2	0.7	But
0.2	1	in
0.9	0.1	many
0.1	0.1	cases,
0.8	0.2	there
0.4	0	is
0.3	0.4	no
1	0.7	escape
0.2	0.7	from
0.1	0.8	this
0.6	0.7	surveillance
0.1	0.6	because
0.9	0.8	there's
0.1	0.4	no
0.1	0.2	alternative.
0.9	0.2	People
0.9	0.1	are
0.9	0.8	stuck
0	0.8	with
0.4	0.4	bad
0.4	0.6	options.
0.5	0.9	Open
0.9	0.1	markets
0.1	0.1	are
0.1	0.6	predicated
0.2	1	on
0.4	0.6	the
0.6	0.1	idea
0.2	0.1	that
0.6	0.1	if
0.9	0.1	a
0.5	0.1	company
0.9	0.3	harms
0.3	0.2	people,
0.2	0.9	consumers,
0.8	0.9	workers,
0.2	0.7	and
0.1	0.7	business
0.3	0.8	partners
0.1	0.2	will
0.1	1	choose
1	0.8	another
0.5	0.9	option.
0.1	0.3	We're
0.4	0.9	here
0.4	0.7	today
0.2	0.3	because
0.3	0.6	that
0.2	0.9	choice
0.9	0.8	is
0.6	0.5	no
0.5	0.8	longer
0.5	0.9	possible.
0.3	0.6	In
0.8	0.9	closing,
0.9	0.6	I'm
0.5	0.4	confident
0.7	0.3	that
1	0.5	addressing
0.7	0.3	the
0.5	0.8	problems
1	0.3	we
0.4	0.2	see
0.7	0.8	in
0.6	0.8	these
0.4	0.1	markets
0.5	0.4	will
0.1	0.6	lead
0.8	0.5	to
0.4	0.8	a
0.5	0.4	stronger,
0.8	0.3	more
0.8	0.9	vibrant
0.4	0.5	economy.
0	0.9	Because
0	0.8	concentrated
0.1	0.7	economic
0.1	1	power
0.6	0.7	also
0.3	0.8	leads
0.7	0.2	to
0.9	0	concentrated
0.1	1	political
0.1	0.3	power,
0.6	0.2	this
0.5	0.6	investigation
0.7	0.1	also
0.9	0.1	goes
0.9	0.7	to
1	0.5	the
0.6	0.5	heart
0.5	0.6	of
0.5	0.9	whether
0.8	0.3	we
0.3	0.8	as
0.7	1	a

0.6	0.9	or

0.1	0.2	we
0.5	0.5	let
0.7	0.6	ourselves
0.8	0	be
1	0.6	governed
0.9	0.8	by
0.1	0.8	private
0.2	0.1	monopolies.
0.1	0.1	American
0.7	0.3	democracy
0.8	0.8	has
0.8	0	always
0.4	0.9	been
0.9	0.3	at
0.3	0	war
0.4	0.4	against

0.3	0.5	power.
0.6	0.3	Throughout
0.1	0.4	our
0.8	1	history,
0.8	0.7	we
0.6	0.2	recognized
0.4	0.6	that
0.8	0.3	concentrated
0.1	0.1	markets
0.5	0.9	and
0.3	0.9	concentrated
0.8	0.7	political
0.5	0.8	control
0.8	0.1	are
0.3	0.8	incompatible
0.6	0.1	with
0.6	0.2	democratic
0.5	0.5	ideals.
0.2	0.1	When
1	0.8	the
0.6	0.2	American
0.9	0.6	people
0.2	0.5	confronted

0.3	0.4	or
0.6	0.3	AT&T
0.7	0.3	and
0.8	0.1	Microsoft,
0.8	0.5	we
0.3	0.1	took
0.3	0.8	action

0.3	0.8	We
1	0.6	face

0.2	0.3	today.
0.3	0.1	As
0.7	0.1	gatekeepers
0.1	0.6	of

0.1	0.9	SENSENBRENNER:
0.5	0	Thank
0.2	0.7	you,
0.1	0.3	Mr.
1	0.9	Chairman.
0.4	0.6	I
0.2	0.8	want
0.3	1	to
0.3	0.7	thank
0.3	0.1	the
0.2	0.5	CEOs
0.3	0.9	for
0.2	0.9	quickly
0.2	0.2	working
0.1	0.5	with
0.1	0.9	the
0.8	0.7	subcommittee
0.7	0.5	to
0.4	0.5	appear
0.8	0	today.
0.7	0	The
0.8	0.4	memorial
0.8	0.9	service
0.4	0.9	for
0.3	0.8	John
0.1	0.4	Lewis
0.6	0.3	on
1	0.6	Monday
0.7	0	required
0.7	0.7	our
0.7	0.5	attention.
0.9	0.5	However,
0.1	0.8	this
0.6	0.6	hearing
0.1	0	is
1	0.2	vital
1	0	to
0.3	0.8	our
0.9	0.6	oversight
0.8	0.9	work,
0.5	0.7	and
0.7	0.9	I
0.2	0.8	appreciate
0.8	0.7	your
0.1	0.2	flexibility.
1	0.1	Throughout
0.1	1	my
0.4	0.2	long
0.3	0.1	time
0.9	0.7	in
0.6	0.9	Congress,
0.5	0.9	I
0.8	0.7	have
0.1	0.2	prioritized
0.3	0.6	oversight
0.7	0.3	as
0.4	0.6	one
0.8	0	of
1	0.6	our
0.6	0.1	seminal
0.5	0.5	responsibilities.
0	0.6	Part
0.5	0.2	of
0.6	0.9	that
0.9	0.8	responsibility
0.3	0.2	is
0.1	0.4	to
0.5	0.4	periodically
0.5	1	review
0.5	0.4	the
0.1	0.2	effectiveness
0.9	0.3	of
0.9	0	our
0.3	0.6	laws.
0.9	0.7	And
0.9	0.1	I
0.8	0.6	think
0.1	0.5	it's
0.9	0.5	a
0.5	0.7	good
0.2	0.6	and
0.1	0.3	timely
0.9	0.9	thing
0.8	0.7	that
0.8	0.3	we
0.4	0.3	are
0.9	0.5	now
0.4	0.4	turning
0.4	0.7	our
1	0.9	attention
0.3	0.5	to
0.2	0.9	technological
0.9	0.8	innovations,
0.9	0.9	which
0.5	0.1	brings
0.9	0.8	us
0.8	0.9	to
0.6	0.7	all
0.7	0.9	of
0.8	0.2	your
0.5	0.4	companies.
0	0.8	Our
0.9	0.8	country,
0.6	0	stricken
0.1	1	by
0.7	0.6	a
0.2	0.3	pandemic,
0.8	0.6	becomes
0.7	0.5	a
0.9	0.3	dramatic
0.8	0.8	illustration
0.1	0.1	of
0.3	0.3	the
0.4	0.4	extraordinarily
0.3	0.2	reliance
0.4	0.1	Americans
0.2	0.1	have
0.7	0.5	on
0.3	0.3	technological
0.8	0.7	innovations.
0.1	0.9	In
0.7	1	these
0.4	0.9	unexpected
0.6	0.2	and
0.7	0.5	unprecedented
0.4	0.8	times,
0.9	0.1	your
0.9	0.7	companies
0.6	0	have
0.2	0.8	provided
0.9	0.3	innovations
0.2	0	so
0.7	0.7	our
0.7	0.1	nations
0.6	1	can
0.5	0.3	meet
0.1	0.5	a
0.6	0.4	myriad
1	0.7	of
0.5	0.1	our
0.9	0.1	daily
0.7	0.5	needs;
0.5	0.2	the
0.8	0.5	delivery
0.8	0.4	of
0.8	0.4	groceries,
0.3	0.3	virtual
0.7	0	visits
0.3	0.9	with
0.5	0.5	doctors,
0.8	0.9	connecting
0.3	0.5	socially
0.1	0.5	distant
0.1	0.9	families,
0.6	0.1	or
0.8	0.5	keeping
0.2	0.6	our
0	0.8	small
0.2	0.5	and
0.6	0.9	large
0.7	1	businesses
0.1	0.7	connected.
0.2	0	With
0.2	0	that
0.7	0.1	responsibility
0.1	1	comes
0.3	0.6	in
0.5	0.3	increased
0.1	0.2	scrutiny
1	0.5	of
0.4	0.8	your
0.5	0.7	dominance
0.2	0.2	in
0.3	0.5	the
0.4	0.3	marketplace.
0.9	0.3	I
0.7	0.3	want
0.7	0.3	to
0.4	0.2	reiterate
0.7	1	something
0.5	1	I've
0.5	0.1	said
0.9	0.6	throughout
0.5	0.4	this
0.6	0.6	investigation.
0.6	0.2	Being
0.8	0.3	big
0.4	0.3	is
0.1	0.1	not
0.8	0.5	inherently
0.3	0.8	bad;
0.9	0.2	quite
0.8	0.3	the
0.6	0.1	opposite.
1	0.8	In
0	0.8	America,
0.7	0.8	you
0.1	0.2	should
1	0	be
0.3	0.1	rewarded
0.8	0.8	for
0.7	0.8	success.
0.1	0.7	We
0.5	0.9	are
0.1	0.1	here
1	0.4	to
0.4	0.9	better
1	0.9	understand
0.5	0.3	the
0.4	0	role
0	0.8	your
0.8	0.3	companies
0.2	0.4	have
0.1	0	in
1	0.9	the
0.9	0.1	digital
0.1	0.4	marketplace
0.2	0.5	and,
0.1	1	importantly,
0.4	0.3	the
0.2	0.6	effect
0.7	0.2	they
0.1	0.7	have
0.4	0.8	on
0.7	0.9	consumers
0.7	0.4	and
0.6	0.1	the
0.1	0	public
0.2	0.5	at
0.8	0.2	large.
0.5	0.8	You
0.5	0.4	lead
0.9	0.1	some
0.9	0.4	of
0.2	0.2	today's
0.1	0.7	most
0.9	0.3	powerful
0.6	0.7	companies,
0.2	0.9	and
0.8	0.1	my
0.3	0.2	colleagues
0.5	0.1	and
0.9	0.4	I
0.8	0.5	have
0	0.8	a
0.5	0.9	great
0.3	0.8	interest
0.5	0.8	about
0.9	0.3	what
0	0.2	your
0.2	0.8	companies
0.9	0	do
0.9	0.3	with
0	0.3	that
0.5	1	accumulated
0	0.9	power.
0.3	0.9	We
0.4	0.8	also
0.6	0.6	know
0.2	0.5	that
0.5	0	the
0	0.1	tech
1	0.8	marketplace
0.3	0.3	is
0.1	0.5	driven
0.3	0.5	by
0.3	0.4	data,
0.3	0.3	so
0.6	0.8	it
0.4	0.4	follows
0.5	0.7	that--
0.7	0.3	
0.5	0.5	
0.8	0.5	SENSENBRENNER:
0.2	0.6	--those
0.6	1	who
0.2	0.8	control
0.6	1	the
0.3	0.8	data,
0.4	0.1	in
0	0.1	essence,
0.7	0.6	control
0.8	0.7	the
0.7	0.3	marketplace.
0.9	0.5	There
0.5	0.5	are
0.9	0.5	broader
0.4	0.1	questions
0.7	0.5	surrounding
0.5	0.3	data,
0.5	0.5	however.
0.7	0.7	Who
0.2	1	owns
0.9	0.7	the
0.7	0.2	data?
0.8	0.9	What
0.7	0.6	responsibilities
0.5	0.9	do
0.4	0.2	companies
0.9	0.5	have
0.5	0.3	to
0.9	0.9	share
0.1	0.9	it
0.3	0.3	with
0.7	0.5	their
0.2	0.6	customers
0.1	0.4	or
0.7	0.4	their
0.3	0.6	competitors?
0.7	0.3	What
0	0.4	is
0.8	0.5	the
0.9	0.8	fair
0.4	0.8	market
0.6	0.9	value
0.8	0.2	of
0.2	0.6	that
0.7	0.6	data?
0.9	0.9	Is
0.1	0.5	there
0.1	0.9	anything
0.7	1	monopolistic
0	0.3	in
0.4	0.9	acquiring
0.7	0.5	this
0.6	0.4	data?
0.8	0.1	And
1	0.2	what
0.5	0.6	about
0.9	0.3	monetizing
0.3	0.2	it?
0.3	0.5	These
0.8	0.2	are
0.8	0.6	complex
0.4	0.8	issues
0.6	0.5	that
0.5	0.4	Congress,
0.3	0.8	regulators
0.1	0.4	and
0.2	0.1	even
0.4	0.9	your
0.1	0.6	own
0.9	0.9	companies
0.1	0.1	are
0.4	0.6	wrestling
0.4	0.6	with
0.3	0.8	in
0.4	0.7	the
0.8	1	current
0.3	0.9	technological
0.5	0.3	landscape
0.2	1	and
0.1	0.8	the
0.2	0.1	answers
0.7	0.8	to
0.4	0.2	which
0.2	0.5	we
0.5	0.2	owe
0.3	0.9	the
0.8	0	American
0.3	0.7	consumers.
0.5	0.2	Since
0.1	0.6	the
0.7	0.6	tech--investigation
0.9	0.4	began,
0.1	0.7	we
0.7	0.5	have
0.1	0.4	heard
0.8	0.6	rumblings
0.8	0.6	from
0.6	0.5	many
0.3	0.7	who
0.8	0.1	are
0.9	0.7	quick
0.8	0.4	to
0.4	0.8	say
0.9	0.5	your
0.7	0.3	successful
0.3	0.1	companies
0.5	0.6	have
0.4	0.7	grown
0.8	0	too
0.4	0.2	large.
0.6	0.5	Since
0.6	0.9	his
0.3	0.7	hearing
0.7	0.1	was
0.9	0	announced,
0.8	0.9	it
0.7	0.3	seems
0.8	0.5	that
0.1	0.9	those
0.1	0.7	complaints
0.1	0.6	have
0.4	0.9	gotten
0.8	0.7	even
0.9	0.9	louder.
0.8	0.1	While
0.2	0.4	I
0	0	find
0	0.3	these
0.7	0.3	complaints
0.2	0.2	informative,
0.1	0.3	I
0.2	0.3	don't
0.6	0.6	plan
0.6	0.5	on
0.1	0.3	it--litigating
0.1	0.5	each
0.8	0.8	of
0.6	0.5	these
0.7	0.8	complaints
0.2	0.8	today.
0.5	0.5	Antitrust
0.1	0.5	law
0.2	0.8	and
0.9	0	the
0.5	0.4	consumer
0.7	0	welfare
0.2	0.6	standard
0.5	0.7	have
0.8	0.4	served
0.3	0.6	this
0.3	0	country
0.1	0.9	well
0.6	0.5	for
0.2	0.5	over
0.6	0.1	a
0.3	0.8	century.
0.6	0.7	Those
0.7	1	laws
1	0.8	have
0.6	0.4	provided
0.6	0.4	the
0.8	0.9	framework
0.1	0.6	and
0.7	0.2	creativity
0.1	0.7	to
0.3	0	make
0.2	0.8	way
0	0.9	for
0.1	0.9	some
0.8	0.3	of
0.7	0.4	our
0.1	0.3	most
0.4	0.6	successful
0.1	0.5	and
0.4	0.4	innovative
0.9	0.7	companies.
0.1	0.9	I
0.1	0.4	will
0.4	0.8	be
0	0.2	the
0.3	0.1	first
0.3	0.5	to
0.3	0.1	highlight
0.9	0.9	that.
0.3	0.3	However,
0.1	0.4	as
0.9	0.8	the
0.9	0.1	business
0.7	0.3	landscape
0.8	0.3	involves,
0.2	0.9	we
0.1	0.4	must
0.2	0.5	ensure
1	0.7	that
0.9	0.1	our
0.1	0.5	existing
0.1	0.5	antitrust
0.3	0.1	laws
0.8	0.1	are
0.2	0.6	applied
0.4	0.7	to
0.5	0.9	meet
0.3	1	the
0.5	0.3	needs
0.4	0.6	of
0.2	0	our
0.5	0.6	country
0	0.5	and
0.8	0.8	its
0.2	0.3	consumers.
0.3	0.4	I
0.6	0.2	share
0.1	0.1	the
0.7	0.6	concern
0.6	0.6	that
0.8	0.2	market
0.4	0.1	dominance
0.4	0.1	in
0.3	0.4	the
0.6	0.8	digital
0.7	0.6	space
0.1	0.5	is
1	0.6	ripe
0.6	0.9	for
0.7	1	abuse,
0.1	0.3	particularly
0.1	0.7	when
0.4	1	it
0.7	0.2	comes
0.1	0.1	to
0.7	0.5	free
0.9	0.4	speech.
0.6	0.5	As
0.8	0.1	we
0.1	0.5	know,
0.1	0.6	companies
1	0.4	like
0.6	0.3	Facebook,
0.1	0.9	Google,
0.6	0	YouTube
0.7	0.3	and
0.2	0.6	Twitter
0.1	0.5	have
0.7	0.6	become
0.1	0.1	the
0.4	0	public
0.3	0.3	square
0.6	0.8	of
1	0.8	today,
0.8	0.9	where
0.3	0.2	political
0.3	0.3	debate
0.9	1	unfolds
0.8	0.7	in
0.9	0.4	real-time.
0.3	0.8	But
0.2	0.9	reports
0.6	0.4	that
0.8	0.4	dissenting
0.9	0.3	views,
0.7	0.8	often
0.7	0.4	conservative
0.7	0.5	views,
0.3	0.2	are
0.4	0.6	targeted
0.8	0.5	or
0.2	0.6	censored
0.2	0.9	is
0.7	0.3	seriously
0.6	0.6	troubling.
0.9	0.3	Conservatives
0.8	0.2	are
0.5	0.9	consumers,
0.9	0.5	too,
0.7	0.6	and
0.9	0.3	they
0.3	0	need
0	0.3	the
0.7	0.7	protection
0.5	0.4	of
0.1	0.7	the
0.6	0.8	antitrust
0.2	0.1	laws.
0.1	0.6	The
0.6	0.1	power
0.6	1	to
0.3	0.9	influence
0.8	0.7	debate
0.5	0.1	carries
0.4	0.5	with
0.3	0.8	it
0.9	1	remarkable
0.8	0.8	responsibilities.
1	0.5	So
0.6	0.4	let
0.9	0.6	the
0.3	1	facts
0.2	0.1	be
0.5	1	our
0.7	0.3	guide
0.6	0.3	here.
0.9	0.5	Your
0.6	0.1	companies
1	0.4	are
0.6	0.6	large.
0.7	1	That's
0.7	0.1	not
0.5	0.3	a
0.9	0.8	problem.
0.3	0.6	Your
0.2	0.9	companies
0.6	0.8	are
0.1	0.3	successful.
0.1	0.4	That's
0.3	1	not
0.8	0.1	a
0.3	0.5	problem
0.3	0.5	either.
0.8	0.6	But
0.3	0.4	I
0.7	0.6	want
0.8	0.9	to
0.8	0.9	leave
0.3	0.1	here
0.5	0.9	today
0.1	0.8	with

0.1	0.6	more
0.6	0.9	complete
0.4	0.8	picture
0.9	0.6	of
0.5	0.8	how
0.5	0	your

1	0.9	use
0.3	0.5	your

0.8	0.2	success
0.5	0.9	and
0.9	0.3	power
1	0.1	and
0.5	0.9	what
0.4	0	it
0.4	0.5	means
0.6	0.9	to
0.8	0.4	the
0.6	0.1	American
0.5	0.4	consumer.
0.6	0.5	And
0.6	0.4	I
0.2	0.6	yield
0.8	0.5	back
0.9	0.5	the

0.6	0.6	all
0.5	0.5	put
0.7	0.9	into
0.6	1	the

0.7	0.5	I
0.3	1	appreciate
1	0.7	your
0.7	1	calling
0.3	0.4	this
0.1	0.1	hearing
0.3	0.4	today
0.7	0.6	so
1	0.3	that
0.6	0.8	we
0.9	0.6	can
0.4	0.4	hear
0.7	1	directly
0.7	0.8	from

0.5	0.2	And
0.8	0.6	I
0.6	0.7	look
0.5	1	forward
0.3	0.4	to
0.6	0.5	an
0.1	0.3	important
0.4	0.9	dialogue.
0.1	0	Today,
0.4	0.4	it
0.6	0.2	is
0.9	0.2	effectively
0.5	0.6	impossible
0	0.9	to

0.6	0.2	or
0.4	0.5	another,
0.6	0.3	the

0.6	0.5	of
0.2	0.6	these
0.6	0.1	four
0.7	0	companies.
0.8	0.4	I
0.8	0.7	have
0.2	0.3	long
0.6	0.7	believed
0.3	0.1	with
0.3	0.4	Thomas
0.9	0.6	Jefferson
0.8	0.8	and
0.8	0.7	Louis
0.6	0.3	Brandeis
0.3	0.1	that

0.3	0.5	in
0.3	0.1	any

0.6	1	especially
0.9	0.3	concentration
0.4	0.9	of
0.6	0	economic
0.1	0.2	or
0.3	0.9	political
0.2	0.7	power,
0.4	0.6	is
0.7	0.7	dangerous
0.7	0.5	to
0	0.1	a
0.8	0.8	democratic
0	0.5	society.
0.3	0.6	That
0.9	0.9	is
0.3	0.7	why
0.6	0.4	we
0.8	0.1	must
0.4	0.6	examine
0.2	0.2	these
1	0.5	and
0.7	0.6	other
0.8	0.7	companies
0.3	0.2	that
0.7	0.6	play
0.1	0.2	a

0.6	0.1	in
0	0.5	our

0.7	0.7	and--and
0.3	0.9	in
0.7	0.8	our
0.4	0.6	society
0.4	0.7	and
0.2	0.4	ensure
0.4	0.8	that
0.8	0.7	our

0.6	0.8	These

0.8	0.4	have
0.9	0.6	guided
0.7	0.8	this
0.1	0.5	committee's
0.8	0.6	yearlong
0.6	0.1	investigation
0.5	0.9	into

0.3	1	and
0.9	0.8	they

0.4	0.7	the
0.6	0.4	lens
0.4	0.1	through
0.7	0.4	which
0.1	0.8	I
0	0.2	approach
0.9	0.6	today's
0.8	0.3	hearing.
0.5	0.6	The
0.6	0.2	open
0.4	0.9	Internet
0.6	0.9	has
0.5	1	delivered
0.3	0.6	enormous

0.8	0.3	including
1	0.3	a

0.5	0.5	But
0.9	0.2	there
0.7	0.1	is
1	0.6	growing
0.8	0.6	evidence
0.1	0	that
0.6	0.7	a

0.8	0.7	My

0.4	0.3	What

0.7	0.8	Twenty
0	0	years
0.5	0.6	ago,
0.1	0.9	we

0.8	0.1	We

0.9	0.1	so
0.5	0.8	profoundly
0.3	0.9	from
0.8	0.5	his

0.2	0.7	My
0.3	0.5	name
0.6	1	is
0.6	0.9	Tim
0.5	1	Cook.
0.1	0.1	I've
0.5	0.3	been
0.1	0.3	Apple's
0.8	0.3	CEO
0.4	1	since
0.3	0.7	2011
0.9	0.3	and
0.4	0.6	a
0.3	0.9	proud
0.8	0.1	employee
0.3	0.8	of
0.4	0.3	this
0.2	0.8	uniquely
0.9	0.6	American
0.7	0.7	company
0.3	0.3	since
0.9	0.5	1998.
0.3	0.6	At
0.7	0.2	Apple,
0.3	0.9	we
0.5	0.3	make
0.2	0.9	ourselves
1	0.7	a
0.5	0.4	promise
0.8	0.8	and
0.3	0.8	our
0.1	0.1	customers
0.3	1	promise.
0.8	0.8	It's
0.1	0.7	a
0.5	0.8	promise
0.3	0.7	that
0	0.7	we'll
0.3	0.5	only
0.9	0.9	build
0.3	0.5	things
0.1	0.8	that
0.4	0.5	make
0	0.7	us
0.8	0.8	proud.
0.1	0.5	As
0.3	0	Steve
0.5	0.3	put
0.5	0.2	it,
0.4	0.7	we
0.9	0.5	only
0	0.9	make
0.3	0.3	things
0.7	0.3	that
0.6	1	we
0.4	0.4	recommend
0.3	0.3	to
0.3	0.6	our
0.5	0.6	family
0.8	0.4	and
0.2	0.1	friends.
0.6	0.2	You
0	1	can
1	0.7	try
0.5	0.2	to
0.3	0.6	define
0.1	0.3	this
0.8	0.4	difference
0.2	0.6	in
0.6	0.1	a
0.3	0.7	lot
0.7	0.8	of
0.6	0	ways.
1	0.3	You
0.9	0.1	can
0.5	0.7	call
0.7	0.4	it
0.5	0.8	that
0.4	0.6	seamless
0.4	0.2	integration
0.6	0.1	of
0.7	0.9	hardware
0	0.2	and
0	0.2	software.
0.5	0.7	You
0.3	0.4	can
0.2	0.6	call
0.2	0.2	it
0.6	0.3	simplicity
0.9	0.1	of
0.8	0.2	design
0.3	0.1	or
0.7	0.4	a
0.5	0.3	great
0.3	0.6	ecosystem
0.9	0.1	all
0.4	0	of
0.8	0.3	those
0.5	0.5	things
0.6	0.1	are
1	0.9	true,
0.1	0.1	but
0.6	0.4	if
0.1	0.7	you
0.3	0.2	want
0.9	0.3	to
0.4	0.8	put
0.2	0.7	it
0.2	0.7	simply,
0.4	0.3	products
0.5	0.6	like
0.5	0	iPhone
0.5	0.3	just
0	0.3	were.
0.4	0.1	When
0.8	0.4	customers
0.9	0.9	consistently
0.8	0.6	give
1	0.5	iPhone
0.8	0.3	a
0.1	0.1	99
0.6	0.8	percent
0.3	0.7	satisfaction
0.6	0.3	rating
0.9	0.5	that
0.8	0.4	is
0.6	0.3	the
0.8	0.9	message
0.3	0.1	they
0.5	0.2	are
0.5	0.9	sending
0	0.6	about
0.9	0.8	the
0.4	0.5	user
0.8	0.7	experience.
0.2	0.7	But
0.1	0.2	we
0.5	0.1	also
0.7	0	know
0.1	0.2	that
0.7	0.4	customers
0.2	0.9	have
0.3	0.6	a
0.3	0.1	lot
0.8	0	of
0.7	1	choices
0.9	1	and
0.5	0.7	that
0.6	0.1	our
0.6	0.6	products
0.3	0.2	face
0.7	0.2	fierce
1	0.6	competition.
0.7	0.8	Companies
0.5	0.9	like
0.8	0.3	Samsung,
0.3	0.5	LG,
0.8	0.2	Huawei,
0.1	0.5	and
0.8	0.5	Google
0.4	0.2	have
0.9	0.5	built
0.1	0.5	successful
0.9	0.6	businesses
0.9	0.5	with
0.6	0.3	different
0.7	0.6	approaches.
1	0.4	We
0.9	0.4	are
0.8	0.8	okay
0	0.4	with
0.3	0.2	that.
0.9	0.3	Our
1	0.2	goal
0.9	0.6	is
0.5	0.8	the
0.8	0.9	best,
0.5	0.7	not
0.1	0.9	the
0	0.4	most.
0.1	0.2	In
0.4	0.5	fact,
0.8	0.3	we
0.1	0.9	don't
1	0.4	have
0.7	0.8	a
0.3	0.2	dominant
0.4	0.3	share
0.8	0.2	in
0.3	0.4	any
0.9	0.8	market
0.7	0.5	or
0.2	0	in
0.1	0.3	any
1	0.1	product
0.3	0.5	category
0.8	0.9	where
0.1	0.2	we
0.1	0.4	do
0.1	0.8	business.
0.4	0.6	What
0.2	0.6	does
0.1	0.4	motivate
0.1	0.8	us
0.5	0	is
0.6	0.2	that
0.8	0.1	timeless
0.2	0.2	drive
0.3	0.3	to
0.5	0.2	build
0.2	0.4	new
0	0.5	things
0.4	0.8	that
0.1	1	we
0.9	0.8	are
0.1	0.5	proud
0.7	0	to
0.7	0.8	show
0.3	0.4	our
0.3	0.3	users.
1	0.4	We
0.6	0.6	focus
0.5	0.5	relentlessly
0.4	0.4	on
0.2	0.2	those
0.3	0.2	innovations,
0.4	0.3	on
0.3	0.3	deepening
1	1	core
0.8	0.9	principles
0.6	0.4	like
0.9	0.9	privacy
0.1	0.3	and
0.9	0.8	security
0.3	0.3	and
0.5	0.7	on
0.6	0.4	creating
0.1	0.3	new
0.8	0	features.
0.7	0.5	In
0.6	0.4	2008
0.4	0.7	we
0.8	0.3	introduced
0.6	0.4	a
0.1	0.1	new
0.5	0.8	feature
0.6	0.8	of
0.3	0.5	the
0.4	0.8	iPhone
0.9	0.9	called
0.8	0.7	the
0.2	0.7	app
0.8	0.4	store
1	0.9	launched
0.5	0.5	with
0.3	0.9	500
0.8	0.8	apps,
0.8	0.4	which
0.1	0.7	seemed
1	1	like
0	0.1	a
0.8	0.5	law
0.2	0.9	that
0.2	0.2	the
0.3	0.7	time.
0.1	0.9	The
0.8	0.7	app
0.8	0.2	store
0.8	0.6	provided
0.8	0.5	a
0.7	0.7	safe
0.2	0.9	and
0.1	0.3	trusted
0.1	0.3	way
0.9	0.9	for
0.1	0.7	users
0.2	0.5	to

0.1	0.4	more
0.9	0.6	out
0.3	0.3	of
0.9	0.5	their
0.9	0.6	phone.
0.2	0.9	We
0.7	0.5	knew
0.1	0.1	the
0.7	0.1	distribution
0.8	0.7	options
0.1	0.4	for
0.1	0.6	software
0.8	0.5	developers
0.3	0.8	at
0.9	0.5	the
0.1	0.9	time
0.9	0	didn't
0.1	0.8	work
0.6	0.5	well.

0.8	0.9	charge
0.1	0.5	high

0.4	0.8	Physical
0.1	0.7	media,

0.4	0.9	shipped
0.7	0.6	and
0	0.8	were
0.1	0.3	hard
0.6	0.1	to
0.9	0.9	update.
0.2	0.1	From
0.6	0.9	the
0.1	0.1	beginning,
0.5	0.8	the
0.4	0.7	app
0.9	0	store
0.3	0.9	was
0.5	0.4	a

0.9	0.3	developers

0.9	0.7	and
0	0.2	never
0.3	0.5	pay
0.5	0.2	for

0.9	0.6	space.
0.1	0.3	We
1	0.6	provide

0.6	0.6	categories
0.9	0.3	of
0.6	0.5	apps.
0.4	0.6	I'm
0.6	0.4	here
0.5	0.1	today
0.2	0.6	because
0.4	0.6	scrutiny
0.1	0.8	is
0.2	0.3	reasonable
0.2	0.8	and
0.6	0.4	appropriate.
0.3	0.7	We
0.5	0.3	approach
1	0.9	this
0.5	0.6	process
0.1	0.1	with
0.1	0.2	respect
0.1	0.4	and
0.9	0.5	humility,
0.3	0.5	but
0.2	1	we
0.6	0.9	make
0.7	0.8	no
0.1	0.6	concession
0.7	0.7	on
0.8	0.5	the
0.9	0.4	facts.
0.8	0.8	What
0.7	0.7	began
0	0.4	as
0.5	0.8	500
0.6	0.2	apps
0.6	0.1	is
0.4	0	now
0.4	0.7	more
0.4	0.7	than
0.7	0.3	1.7
0.1	0.4	million,
0.1	1	only
0.2	0.8	six
1	0.8	of
1	0.5	which
0.2	0.5	are
0.1	0.4	Apple
0.4	0.2	software.
0.4	0.6	If
0.7	0.9	Apple
0.8	0.5	is
0.5	0.6	a
0.4	0	gatekeeper,
0	0.9	what
0.2	0.9	we
0.5	0.9	have
0.8	1	done
0.6	0.1	is
0.7	0.5	open
0.3	0.8	the
0.9	0.9	gate
0	0.2	wider.
0.6	0.1	We
0.9	0.6	want
0.9	0.7	to
0.7	0.1	get
0.3	0.3	every
0.7	0	app
0.1	0.1	we
0.5	0.2	can
0.7	0.1	on
0.8	0.5	the
0.2	0.9	store,
0.2	0.8	not
0.7	0.7	keep
0.3	0.6	them
0	1	off.
0.1	0.8	The
0.1	0.6	app
0.8	0.6	store's
0.8	0.2	economic
1	0.9	contributions
0.1	0.5	are
0.8	0.2	significant.
0.6	0.2	The
0.5	0.8	ecosystem
0.5	0.2	is
0.9	1	responsible
0.7	0.5	for
0.9	0.1	1.9
0.4	0.7	million
0.5	0.6	jobs
0.1	0.6	in
0	0.9	all
0.5	0.7	50
0.6	1	states,
0.3	0.8	and
0.8	0.9	it
0.4	0.6	facilitated
0.1	0.4	$138
0.7	1	billion
0.4	0.3	in
0.5	0.4	commerce
0.6	0.4	in
0	0.1	the
0.8	0.7	U.S.
0.5	0.2	in
0.7	0.9	2019
0.2	0.7	alone.
0.5	0.5	I
0.9	0	share
0	1	the
0.3	1	committee's
0.6	0.7	belief
0.1	0.2	that
0.1	0.1	competition
0.7	0.8	promotes
0.5	0.4	innovation,
0.3	0.3	that
1	0.6	it
0.8	0.8	makes
0.8	0	space
0.4	0.9	for
0.1	0.5	the
0.2	0.8	next
0.2	0.2	great
0.2	0.7	idea,
0.7	1	and
0.7	0.5	that
0.7	0.6	it
0.2	0.6	gives
0.3	0.8	consumers
0	0.2	more
0.1	0.3	choices.
0.3	0.1	Since
0.9	0.6	Apple
0.5	0.3	was
0.8	0.5	founded,
0.9	1	these
0.9	0.2	things
0.7	0.5	have
0.1	0.4	defined
0.1	0.8	us.
0.9	0.7	The
0.1	0	first
0.2	0.3	Mac
0.8	0.3	brought
0.5	1	opportunity
0.5	0.5	and
0	0.9	possibility
0.2	0.9	into
0.8	0.1	the
0.3	0.1	home.
0.7	0.1	The
0.7	0.7	iPod
0.9	0.7	helped
0.5	0.8	musicians
0.8	0.1	and
0.3	0.7	artists
0.8	1	to
0.6	0.1	share
0.2	0.2	their
0.8	0.6	creations
0.4	0.9	and
1	0.3	be
0.1	0.8	paid
0.4	0.2	fairly
0.3	0.7	for
0.9	0.7	it.
0.6	0.3	This
0.3	0.9	legacy
0.9	0.5	does
0.1	0.8	much
0.1	0.1	more
0.3	1	than
0.7	0.9	make
0.7	0.1	us
0.9	0.1	proud.
0.1	0.1	It
0.5	0.7	inspires
0.7	0.2	us
0.2	0.7	to
1	0.7	work
0.2	0.9	tirelessly
0.8	0.5	to
0.5	0.7	make
0.9	0.6	sure
0.3	0.9	tomorrow
0.5	0.2	will
0.7	0.3	be
1	0.8	even
0.9	0.4	better
0.3	0.5	than
0.7	0.7	today.
0.6	0.6	Thank
0.4	0.8	you
0	0.9	very
0.9	0.1	much.
0	0.4	I

0.7	0.4	The

0.9	1	is
0.3	0.2	an
0.2	0.8	American
0.7	0.5	success

0.7	0.6	The

0.6	0.1	Our

0.1	0.2	is
0.8	0.2	part
0.2	0.4	of
0	0.2	this
0.1	0.1	story.
0.8	0.7	We
0.8	0.6	started
0.3	0.5	with
0.3	0.7	an
0.7	0.6	idea
0.6	0.3	to
0.1	0.9	give
1	0.4	people
0.6	0.8	the

0.9	0.6	to
0.3	0.9	share
0.4	0.5	and
0.6	0.7	connect,
0.2	0.7	and
0.2	0.9	we
0.5	0.8	have
0.8	0.1	built
0.5	0.3	services
0.3	0.9	that
0.2	0.8	billions
0.1	0.7	of
0.2	0.3	people
0	0.8	find
0.5	0.9	useful.
0.2	0.4	I
0.4	0	am
0.8	0.2	proud
0.3	0.6	that

0.5	0.3	have
0.8	0.2	given
0.4	0.1	people
0.5	0	who've
0.5	0.6	never

0.5	0.9	a

1	0.9	before
0.8	1	the

0.7	0.8	heard
0.1	0.3	and
0.8	0.4	given
1	0.6	small
0.8	0.8	businesses
0.6	0.6	access
0.7	0.7	to

0.2	0.3	largest
0.1	0.8	players
0.2	0.2	use
1	0.1	to
0.3	0.2	have.
0.5	0.6	Since
0.6	0.7	COVID
0.4	0.6	emerged,
0.4	0.5	I
0.1	0.7	am
0.9	0.1	proud
0.9	0.4	that
0	0.8	people
0.8	0.9	have
0.8	1	used
0.8	0.3	our

0.4	0.4	when
0.7	0.1	physical
0.8	0.2	stores
0.1	0.3	are
0.8	0.6	closed.
0.8	0.8	I
0.3	0.4	believe
0.9	0.3	that
1	0.1	Facebook
0.3	0.6	and
0.6	0.6	the
0.7	0.9	U.S.
0.7	1	tech

0.3	0.8	and
0.2	0.8	empowering
0.6	0.1	people,
0.3	0.2	but
0.7	0.5	I
0.4	0	recognize
0.1	0.3	that
0.4	0.3	there
0.7	0.5	are
0.3	0.1	concerns
1	0	about

0.9	0.5	our
0.6	0.3	business
0.5	0.2	model
0.1	1	is
1	0.4	advertising,
0.6	0.3	and
0.1	0.2	we
0.2	0	face
0.9	0.9	some
0.1	0	intense
0.8	0.1	competition
0.8	0.6	in
0.4	0.8	both.
0.9	0.2	Many
0.3	0.8	of
0.1	0.9	our
0.9	0.9	competitors
0.2	0.9	have
1	0.7	hundreds
0.4	0.6	of
0.8	0.3	millions
0.3	0.4	or
0.8	0.5	billions
0.4	0.6	of
0.1	0.3	users,
0.1	1	some
0	0.5	are
0.7	0.6	upstarts,
0.2	0.8	but
0.3	0.9	others
0.3	0.3	are

0.3	0.3	with
0.2	0.1	the
0.6	0.8	power
0.4	0.6	to
0.5	0.2	decide
0.6	0.8	if

0.9	0.5	In
0.9	0.3	many
0.2	0.7	areas,
0.6	0.7	we
0.1	0.8	are
0.8	0.1	behind
0.7	0.6	our

0.6	0.2	is

0.5	0.3	We

0.8	0.8	talk
0.5	0.3	about
0.4	0.3	online
0.6	0.3	platforms,
0.7	0.7	but
0.8	0	I
0.5	0.4	think
0.3	0.7	the
0.9	0.6	true
0.6	0.8	nature
0	0.2	of
0.6	0.6	competition
0.3	0.3	is
0.2	0.8	much
0.7	0.1	broader.
0.8	0.1	When
0.2	0.8	Google
0.4	0.4	bought
0.6	0.5	YouTube,
0.6	0.1	they
0.8	0.3	could
0.1	0.4	compete
0.6	0.5	against
0.1	0.6	the
0.9	0.1	dominant
0.2	0.9	player
0.3	1	in
0.7	0.3	video,
0.2	0.4	which
0.6	0	was
0.8	0.3	the
0.2	0.1	cable
0.2	0.1	industry.
0.1	0.5	When
0.2	0.8	Amazon
0.6	0.9	bought
0.3	0.6	whole
0.6	0.9	foods,
0.2	0.7	they
0.1	0.1	could
0.1	0.4	compete
0.8	0.7	against
0.6	0.3	Kroger's
0.9	0.3	and
0.8	0.8	Walmart.
0.7	0.6	When
0.9	0.3	Facebook
0.4	0.8	bought
0.4	0.6	WhatsApp,
0.6	0.6	we
0.2	0.9	can
0.6	0.7	compete
0	0.7	against
0.2	0.6	telcos,
0	0.7	who
0.6	0.6	use
1	0.1	to
0.8	0.7	charge
0.8	0.8	$.10
0.1	0.3	a
0.2	0.4	text
0.3	0.5	message
0.7	0.7	but
0.7	0.4	not
0.1	0.3	anymore.
1	0.8	Now
0.3	0.6	people
0.8	0.8	can
1	0.5	watch
0.3	0.2	video,
0.2	0.7	get

0.7	0.9	messages
0.3	0.1	for
0.1	0.6	free.
0.9	0.1	That
0.7	0.6	is
0.8	0.2	competition.
0.1	0.1	New
0.7	0.6	companies
0.9	0	are

0.8	0.8	history

0.2	0.2	the

0.7	0.7	while

0.5	0.8	issues
0.2	0.7	and

0.9	0.8	the
0	0.6	topic
0.6	0.8	of
0.5	0.3	today's
0	0.8	hearing,
0.4	0.4	I
0.6	0.1	recognize
0.8	1	that
0.9	0.8	we
0.9	0.4	are
0.5	0.8	often
0.9	0.3	at
0.9	0.5	the
0.4	0.8	center
0.8	0.6	of
0.6	0.8	these
0.6	0.8	discussions.
0.4	0.1	We
0.8	0.6	build
0.8	0.9	platforms
0.5	0.8	for
0.1	0.9	sharing
0.7	0.7	ideas,
0.7	0.3	and
0.6	0.8	important
0.6	0.1	debates

0.4	0.9	out
0.5	0.6	across
0.2	0.1	our
0.1	0.1	services.
0.6	0.8	I
0.6	1	believe
0.3	0.9	that
0.7	0.1	this
0.9	0.4	ultimately
0.3	0.9	leads
0.1	0.2	to
1	0.6	more
0.5	0.6	progress,
0.1	0.2	but
0.7	0.4	it
1	0.5	means
0.3	0.8	we
0.3	0.9	often
0.5	1	find
0.8	0.4	ourselves
0.7	0.6	in
0.4	0	the
0.4	0.3	middle
0.3	0.1	of

0.8	0.1	social
0.8	0.4	issues
0.8	0.3	and
0.9	0.8	high-stakes
0.5	0.5	elections.
0.6	0.1	I
0.3	0.3	personally
0.4	0.1	don't
0.2	0.8	believe
0.3	0.3	that
0.3	0.3	private
0.2	0.7	companies
0.4	0.7	should
0.5	0.9	be
0.6	0.5	making
0.1	0.4	so
0.2	0.4	many

0.4	0.9	about
0.9	0.6	these
0.8	0.8	issues
0.5	0.4	by
0.7	0.1	themselves,
0.6	0.9	and
0.1	1	that
0.5	0.9	is
0.1	0.8	why
0.2	0.5	last
0.5	1	year,
0.7	0	I
0.3	0.3	made
0.2	0.5	the

0.5	0.2	new
0.9	0.1	regulation
0.2	0.5	for
0.1	1	the
0.2	0.1	Internet.
0.4	0.6	Facebook
0.6	0.3	stands
0.1	0.2	for
0.3	0.2	a
0.4	0.5	set
0.2	0.1	of

0.1	0.2	principles
0.4	0.8	giving
0.3	0.1	people
0.7	0.6	voice
0.2	0.3	and
0.7	0.3	economic
0.3	0.9	opportunity,
0.1	0.1	keeping
0.6	0.9	people
0.2	0.5	safe,
0.7	0.1	upholding
0.4	0.3	democratic
0.7	0.6	traditions
0.9	0.7	like
0.9	0.2	freedom
0.4	0.4	of
0.3	0.6	expression
0.2	0.6	and
0.6	0.7	voting,
0.7	0.4	and

1	0.3	These
0.2	0.7	are
0.6	0.3	fundamental
0.3	0.3	values
0.9	0.8	for
0.6	0.4	most
0.3	0.2	of
0.2	0.8	us
0.9	0.3	but
0.4	0.1	not
0.3	0	for
0.3	0.3	everyone
0.2	0.4	in
0.6	0.3	the
0.9	0.3	world,
0.6	0.2	not
0.5	0.7	for
0.5	0.1	every

0.4	0.9	we
0.5	0.5	compete

0.8	0.7	and
1	0.8	as
1	0.2	global
0.8	0	competition
0.1	1	increases,
0.9	0.4	there
0.8	0.7	is

0.9	0.5	out.
0.2	0.1	I
0.1	0.5	am
0.8	0.4	proud
0.3	0.5	of

0.5	0.5	we
0.8	0.6	build

0.6	0.9	how
0.3	0.7	they
0.5	0.4	improve
0.7	0.1	people's
0.5	0.2	lives.
0	0.9	We
0.5	0.8	compete
0.8	0	hard,
0.2	0.9	we
0.1	0.8	compete
0.1	0.4	fairly,
1	0.8	we
0.6	0.8	try
0.4	0.8	to
0.5	0	be
0.2	0.4	the
0.1	0.7	best,
0.1	0.4	that
0.1	0.7	is
0.5	0.7	what

0.7	0.1	matters
0.4	0.4	in
0.5	0.4	this

0.4	0.3	and
0.3	0.2	when
0.4	0	we
0.5	0.4	succeed
1	0.5	it
1	0.7	is
0.9	1	because
0.4	0.7	we

0.2	0.3	Mr.
0.2	0.5	Pichai,
0.1	0.4	over

1	0	percent
0.1	0	of
0.9	1	all
0.7	0.8	online

0.8	0.3	Every

0.4	0	in
0.5	0.7	the
0.8	0.1	United
0.7	0	States
0.5	0.3	depends
1	0.9	on
0.4	1	Google
0.3	0.5	to
0.2	0.3	reach
0.1	0.2	users.
0.9	0.4	A
0.6	0.8	business
0.4	0.3	may
0.4	0.7	sink
0.8	0.5	or
0.9	0.9	swim
0.8	0.7	based
0.2	0.8	on
0.3	0.5	Google's
1	0.4	decisions
0.4	0.5	a
0.6	0.7	loan.
0.2	0.6	Numerous
0.9	0.8	online
0.9	0.3	businesses
0.3	0.1	told
0.2	0.7	us
0.1	0.1	that
0.8	0.7	Google
0.4	0.7	steals
0.9	1	their
0.1	0.7	content
0.3	0.6	and
0.5	0.3	privileges

0.2	0.2	that

0.6	1	Google
0.6	0.8	but
0.1	0.7	crush
0.6	0.6	everyone
0.5	0.2	else.
0.1	0.6	Most
0.5	0.3	businesses
0.1	0.8	ask
0.8	0.1	to
0	0.7	stay
0.6	0.4	anonymous
0.6	0.4	due
0.1	0.3	to
0.7	0.6	fears
0.1	0.8	that
0.5	0.4	Google
0.8	0.3	would
0.6	0.2	retaliate
0.3	0.4	against
0.1	0.7	them.
0.6	0.4	One
0.8	0.4	entrepreneur
0.7	0.5	Brian
0.1	0.3	Warner(SP)
0.8	0.8	told
0.5	0.3	us
0.4	0.2	his
0.7	0.6	website
0.7	1	was
0.8	0.7	driving
0.6	0.1	until
0.1	0.7	Google
0.7	0.8	stole
0.8	1	his
0.1	0.4	content.
0.6	0.1	After
0.5	0.3	Google's
0.8	0.6	decision
0.6	0.4	traffic
0.7	0.1	to
0.9	0.8	his
0.1	0.9	website
0	0.3	dropped
0.2	0.3	by
0.3	0.4	80
0.8	0.3	percent.
0.9	0	He
0.1	0.1	had
0.7	0.7	to
0	0.2	downsize
0.5	0.8	his
0.2	0.1	business
0.8	0.8	and
0.3	0.5	lay
0.1	0.3	off
0.5	0.4	half
0.3	0.2	his
0.4	0.1	staff.
0.9	0.2	He
0.5	0.4	told
0.6	0.9	us,
0.9	0.6	and
0.9	0.5	I
0.2	0	quote
0.4	0.6	if
0.6	0.6	someone
0.5	0.4	came
0.8	1	to
0.6	0.1	me
0.4	0	with
0.3	0.9	an
0.5	0.5	idea
0.6	0.3	for
0.1	0.5	a

0.4	0.3	or
0.3	0.3	a
0.6	0.4	web
0.7	0.1	service
0.2	0.3	today,
0.8	0.8	I
1	0.8	would
0.5	0.8	tell
1	0.5	them
0.4	0.2	to
0.5	0.3	run,
0.6	0.9	run
0.4	0.2	as
0.7	0.3	far
0.6	0.6	away
0.5	0.9	from
0.5	0.9	the
0.6	0.8	web
0.1	0.6	as
0.6	0.8	possible.
0.4	0.6	Launch
1	0.2	a
0.6	0.8	lawn
0.6	0.2	care
0.5	0.3	business
0.9	0.8	or
0.2	0.4	dog
0.8	0.1	grooming
0.3	0.6	business,
0.6	0.1	something
0.4	0	Google
0.6	0.7	can't
0.7	0.7	take
0.5	0.2	away
0.1	0.6	as
0.5	0.2	soon
0	0.1	as
0.3	0.4	he
0	0.1	or
0.3	0.3	she
0	0.7	is
0.6	0.6	thriving.
0.3	0.8	So
0.7	0.4	my
0.4	0.6	first
0.5	0.9	question
1	0.6	Mr.
0.1	0.7	Pichai
0.5	0.3	is
1	0.6	why
0.8	0.9	does
0.2	0.8	Google
0.7	0.7	steal
0.4	0.6	content
0.2	0.4	from
0.1	0.1	honest
0.2	0.1	businesses.
0.1	0.2	
1	0.8	
0.2	0.6	PICHAI:
0.5	0.9	Mr.
0.6	1	Chairman,
1	0.3	with
0.5	0.5	respect,
0.2	0.9	I
1	0	disagree
0.5	1	with
1	0.3	that
0.5	0.4	characterization.
0.1	0.8	Just
0.5	0.1	last
0.8	0.1	week,
0.7	0.8	I
0.7	0.8	met
0.1	0.8	with
0.1	0.2	many
0.2	0.5	small
0.2	0.2	businesses.
0.6	0.2	In
0.1	0.2	fact,
0.6	0.1	today,
0.3	0.2	we
0.4	0.3	support
0.1	0.9	1.4
0.9	0.3	million
1	0.3	small
0.1	0.7	businesses,
0.1	0.5	supporting
0.7	0.1	over
0.5	0.2	$385
0.1	0.9	billion
0.4	0.9	dollars
0.9	0.7	in
0.3	0	the
0.8	0.4	economic
0.5	0.2	activity.
0.4	0.2	We
0.4	0.8	see
0.6	0.5	many
0.7	0	businesses
0.8	0.2	try,
1	0.4	particularly
0.2	0.8	even
0.2	0.7	during
0.7	0.4	the
0.5	0.8	pandemic,
0.5	0.3	businesses--an
0.6	0.4	example,
0	0.5	Kettle
1	0.9	Kings
0.2	0.1	in
0.6	0.1	Texas
0.5	0.8	which
0.2	0.5	sells
0.5	0.7	kettlebells,
0.1	0.4	they've
0	0.4	really
0.7	0.9	expanded--
1	0.5	
0.7	0.1	
0.6	0.3	CICILLINE:
0.9	0.4	--Well,
0.3	0.9	Mr.
0.3	0.2	Pichai,
0.6	0.1	I
0.4	0.8	have
0.6	0.1	a
0.4	0.4	limited
0.8	0.6	amount
0.3	0.3	of
0.2	0.4	time,
0.8	0.8	so
0.3	0.6	I
0.1	0.3	don't
0.3	0.7	want
0.5	0.2	to
0.6	0.8	interrupt
0.4	0	you,
0.8	0.2	but
0.7	0.3	my
0.1	1	question
0	0.8	is
0.4	0.3	very
0	0.7	specific.
0.8	0.1	We
0	0.8	heard
0	0.5	throughout
0.8	0.5	this
0.8	0.3	investigation
0.3	0.8	that
0.7	0.3	Google
0.3	0.1	has
0.1	0.1	stolen
0.7	0.1	content
0.3	0.3	to
0.1	0.8	build
0.7	0.6	your
0.4	0.7	own
0.5	0.1	business.
0.7	0.7	These
0.8	0.7	are
0.9	0.5	consistent
0.2	0.6	reports,
0.1	1	and
0.9	0	so,
0.9	0.5	your--your
0.1	0.5	testimony
0.1	0.8	that
0.2	0.9	that
0.3	0.7	doesn't
0.5	0.1	happen
0.6	0.8	is
0.1	0.9	really
0.3	0.3	inconsistent
0.5	0.9	with
0.6	0.9	what
0.3	0.8	we've
0	0.9	learned
0.9	0.8	over
0.1	0.5	the
0.8	0.7	course
0.6	0.2	of
0.5	0.3	the
0.6	0.5	investigation.
0.8	0.3	But--but
0.5	0.4	I'll
0.9	0.6	move
0.9	0.6	on
0.3	0.4	to
0.7	0.4	a
0.8	0.3	new
0.7	0.4	question.
0.1	0.5	Mr.
0.3	0.8	Pichai,
0.8	0.5	most
0.6	0.8	Americans
0.3	0.5	believe
0.2	1	that
0.9	0.3	when
0.6	0.8	they
0.8	0.2	enter
0.8	0.5	a
0.1	0.2	search
0.1	0	query,
0.5	0.9	that
0.1	0.8	what
0.2	0.5	Google
0.9	0.5	shows
0.6	0.8	are
0.3	0.2	the
0.7	0.3	most
0.7	0.2	relevant
0.8	0.7	results.
1	0.5	But
0	0.1	increasingly,
0	0.2	Google
0.1	0.4	just
0.8	0.1	shows
0.7	0.4	whatever's
0.7	0.6	most
0.9	0.1	profitable
0.1	0.1	for
0.7	0.2	Google,
0.7	0.8	be
0.9	0.5	it
0.6	0.7	Google
0	0	ads
0.7	0.4	or
1	0.2	Google's
0.8	0.5	own
0.2	0.1	sites.
0.9	0.5	And
0.1	0.2	so
0.3	0.8	my
0.3	0	question,
0.3	0.5	Mr.
0.4	0.1	Pichai,
0.6	1	isn't
0.8	0.3	there
0.9	0.4	a
0.7	0.8	fundamental
0.1	1	conflict
0	0.7	of
0.5	0.3	interest
0.2	0.2	between

0.9	0.6	users
0.9	0.4	who

0.3	0.5	and
0.5	0.1	most

0.5	0.6	and
0.1	0.1	Google's
0.1	1	business
0.2	0.1	model
0.4	0.1	which
0.1	0.8	incentivizes
0.2	0.3	Google
0.9	0.6	to
0.2	0.8	sell
0.9	0.9	ads
0.7	0.4	and
0.2	0.9	keep
0.8	0.1	users
0.7	0.4	on
0.5	0.8	Google's
0.3	0.3	own
0.9	0.6	sites?
0.2	0.7	
0.9	0.9	
0.7	0.8	PICHAI:
0.5	0.2	We
0.4	0.1	have
0.4	0.7	always
0.2	0.3	focused
0.7	0.8	on

0.4	0.1	the
0.3	0	most
0.8	0.2	relevant
0.2	0.5	information,
0.7	0.9	and
0.2	0.2	we
0.7	0.7	rely
0.3	0.1	on
0.6	0.9	the
0.5	0.6	trust
0.3	0.1	for
0.3	0.4	users
0.4	0.2	to
0.5	0.3	come
0.6	0.7	back
0	0.3	to
0.9	0.7	Google
0.2	0.5	every

0.5	0	In
0.7	0.3	fact,
0.4	0.7	a
0	0.6	vast
0.4	0.9	majority
0.2	0.3	of
0.1	0.5	queries
0.7	0.5	in
0.1	0.2	Google,
0.8	0.5	we
0.9	1	don't
1	0.5	show
0.1	0.8	ads
0.7	0.1	at
0.4	0.3	all,
0.3	0.4	and
0.7	0.3	we
0.2	0.3	show
0.8	0.3	ads
0.5	0.1	only

0.2	0.9	small
0.2	0.3	subset
0.9	0.7	of
0.5	0.9	queries
0.7	0.3	where
0.4	0.9	the
0.8	0.8	intent
0.3	0	from
0.2	0.4	users
0.5	0.2	is
0.3	0.4	highly
0.1	1	commercial.
0.3	0.8	For
0.8	0.3	example,
0	0.7	they
0.5	0.8	may

1	0.6	
0.7	0	CICILLINE:
0.9	0.9	But
0.3	0.2	Mr.
0.9	0.8	Pichai,
0.1	0.5	what

0.7	0.6	the--what

0.6	0.8	the

0.3	0.7	of

0.3	0.6	I

0.5	0.5	$200

0.7	0.1	
0.6	0.7	PICHAI:

0.9	0.6	Let--let

0.3	0.7	Really,
0.8	0.2	Mr.
0	0.3	Pichai,
0.6	0.1	it's

0.9	0.3	model
0	0.9	that
0.7	0.8	is
0.5	0.6	the

0.6	0.1	But
0.7	0.6	we
0.5	0	are
0.4	0.3	really
0.2	0.6	focused
0.4	0.5	on
0.6	0.1	improving
0.8	0.6	our
0.2	0.6	products,
0	0.4	and
0.3	0.5	that's
0.1	0.3	how
0.5	0	search
0.7	0.9	works,
0.3	0	we
0.9	0.6	are--
0.2	0.8	
0.8	0.5	
0.1	0.1	CICILLINE:
0	0.7	--I
0.7	0.5	appreciate
0.4	0.1	that,
1	0.4	Mr.
0	0.5	Pichai.
0.9	0.3	Google's
0.2	0.4	own
1	0.2	documents
0.2	0.2	in
0.5	1	numerous
1	0.6	interviews
0.2	0.9	with
0.7	0.2	companies
0.7	0.6	affected
0.5	0.1	by
0.9	0.5	this
0.8	0.9	conduct
0.2	0.3	show
0.2	0.9	that
0.2	0.9	Google
0.2	0.8	did
0	0.4	just
0.4	0.8	that,
0.5	0.5	which
0.6	0.8	is
0.2	0.2	very
0.3	0.6	disturbing
0.3	0.4	and
0.9	0.4	very
0.2	0.2	anti-competitive.
0.2	0.3	In
0.1	0.7	addition
0.1	0.7	to
0.9	0.8	stealing
0.7	0.1	content,
0.3	0.8	Google
0.1	0	also
0.8	0.1	began
0.1	0.4	to
0.5	0.2	privilege
0.6	0.7	its
0.3	0.8	own
0.8	0.2	sites.
0.7	0.1	An
0.8	0.3	investigative
0.4	0.1	report
0.9	0.2	published
0.1	0.7	just
0.1	0.7	yesterday
0.7	0.7	found
0.3	0.6	that
1	0	63
0.8	0.8	percent
0.2	0.7	of
0.5	0.1	web
0.2	0	searches
0.7	0	that
0.2	0.8	start
0.9	0.7	on
0.4	0.9	Google
0.9	1	also
0.9	0.7	end
0	0.1	somewhere
0.4	0.4	on
0.1	0.7	Google's
0.1	0.9	own
0.1	0.3	websites.
0.2	0.4	And
0.4	0.7	to
0.4	0	me,
0.3	0.7	that's
0.1	0.1	evidence
0.4	0.1	that
0.8	0.1	Google
0.1	0.9	is
0.8	0.4	increasingly
0.2	0.7	a
0.3	0.3	walled
0	0.7	garden
1	0.3	which
0.8	0.6	keeps
0.4	0	users
1	0.6	on
0	0.3	Google's
0.4	0.4	sites,
0.8	0.3	even
0.3	0.6	if
0.9	0.7	Google
0.7	0.6	doesn't
0.1	0.3	have
0.5	0.8	the
0.1	0.3	most
0.8	0.7	relevant
0.3	0.5	information,
0.2	0.8	and
0.8	1	it's
0.8	0.1	economically
0.3	0.3	catastrophic
0.7	0.8	for
0.7	0.3	other
0.8	0	companies
0.2	0.1	online.
0.7	0.6	And
0.3	0	so,
0.1	0.6	my
0.9	0.2	time
0	0.8	is
0.8	0.7	running
0.9	0.4	out,
0.2	0.9	but
0.5	0.5	Mr.
0	0.8	Pichai,
0.5	0.6	I'll
0.3	0.8	just
0	0.2	end
0.6	0.9	by
0	0.5	saying,
0.6	0.8	the
0.7	0.1	evidence
0.2	1	seems
0.6	0.4	very
0.4	1	clear
0.8	0.6	to
0.6	0.5	me;
1	0.5	as
0.6	0.9	Google
0.6	0.9	became
0.5	0.8	the
0.8	0.6	gateway
0.3	0	to
0.8	0.4	the
0.3	0.1	internet,
0.9	0	it
0.9	0.5	began
0.1	0.8	to
0.9	0.9	abuse
0.7	0.5	its
0.7	0.4	power.
0.9	0.1	It
0.5	0.3	used
0.6	0.3	its
0.5	0.4	surveillance
0.8	0.9	over
0.9	0.1	web
0.3	0.1	traffic
0	0.6	to
0.5	0.1	identify
0.2	0	competitive
0.7	0.6	threats
0.5	0.8	and
0.3	1	crushed
0.2	0.7	them.
0.6	0.8	It
0.8	0.5	has
0.8	0.4	dampened
0.5	0.8	innovation
0.3	0.5	and
0.8	0.1	new
0.5	0.1	business
0.8	0.7	growth,
0	0.6	and
0.1	0.6	it's
0.8	0.1	dramatically
0.6	0.1	increased
0.8	0.6	the
0.2	0.5	price
0.7	0.9	of
0.9	0.7	accessing
0.1	0.7	users
0.3	0.5	on
0.9	0.2	the
0.5	0.6	internet,
0.4	1	virtually
0.8	0.7	ensuring
0.3	0.3	that
1	0.2	any
0.2	0.7	business
0.2	0.6	that
0.8	0.1	wants
0.9	1	to
0.1	0.3	be
0.2	0.7	found
0	0.3	on
0.8	0.1	the
0.5	0.1	web
0.5	0.1	must
0.7	0.8	pay
0.6	0.5	Google
1	0.2	a
0.8	0.1	tax.
0.3	0.5	And
0.1	0.3	with
0.3	0.9	that,
0.6	0.5	I
0	0.3	recognize
0.4	0.6	the
0.6	0.9	Ranking
0.3	0.7	Member
0.6	0.7	of
0.1	0.2	the

0.3	0.9	
0.4	0.1	
0.4	0.9	SENSENBRENNER:
0.7	0.7	Thank

0.3	0.6	that's
0.2	0.2	coming
0.1	0.4	to
0.2	0.2	an
0.6	0.6	end
0.7	0.7	at
0.3	0.3	the
0.5	0.8	end
0.7	0.5	of
0.6	0.8	this
0.1	0.1	year;
0.4	0.6	I'm

1	0.7	of

0.1	0.4	Look,

0.5	0.3	you
0.7	0.4	know,
0.6	0.3	I
0.8	0.1	was

0.7	0.5	that
0.1	0	we

0.9	1	is
0.2	0.7	that
0.2	0	the

0.7	0.8	should
0.1	0.8	end
0.3	0.9	up
0	0.1	becoming

0.4	0.2	you

0.6	0.3	Conservatives
0	0.8	are
0.9	0.3	consumers
0.2	0.8	too,
0.7	0.6	and
0.2	0.9	the

0.6	0.8	of

0.5	0.9	is
0.8	0.7	that

0.3	0.2	"filtering

0.7	0.2	agree
0.3	0.2	with?
0.9	0.3	
0.7	0.2	
0	0.9	ZUCKERBERG:
0	0.2	Congressman,
0.7	0.4	thank
0.2	0.2	you
0.9	0	for
0.6	0.5	the--the
0.5	0.6	opportunity
0.6	0.2	to
0.3	0.1	address
0.6	0.1	this.
0.3	0.3	Our
0.4	0.4	goal
0.9	0.2	is
0.6	0.2	to
0.3	0.5	offer
0.2	0.9	a
0.4	0.5	platform
1	0.4	for
0.1	0.8	all
0.6	0	ideas.
0.9	0.6	We
0.6	0.5	want
1	0.9	to
0.4	0.1	give
0.2	0.9	everyone
0.1	0.3	in
1	0.2	the
0.8	0.1	world
0.1	0.4	a
0.9	0	voice
0.6	0.9	to
0.9	0.4	share
0.7	1	their--their
0.1	0.2	experiences
0.3	0.8	and
0.9	1	ideas,
0.8	0.5	a
0.5	0.9	lot
0.5	0.6	of
0.7	0.5	that
0.3	0.2	is
0.6	0.1	day-to-day
0.1	0.8	things
0.4	0.3	that
0.2	0.1	happen
0.8	0.5	in
0.5	0.9	their
0.6	0.3	lives,
0.8	0.1	some
0.9	0	of
1	0.3	it
0	1	is
0.6	0.6	political.
0.9	0.9	And
0	0.3	frankly,
0.5	0.1	I
0	0.3	think
0.3	0.2	that
0.9	0.6	we
0.3	0.8	have
0.7	0.8	distinguished
0.5	0	ourselves
0.4	0.3	as
0.6	1	one
0.9	0	of
0.7	0.8	the--the
0.9	0.3	companies
0.2	0	that
0.2	0.7	defends
0.2	0.4	free
0.8	0.1	expression
0.9	0.2	the
0.8	0.4	most.
0.3	0.7	We
0.6	0.8	do
0.7	0.1	have
0	0.5	community
0.9	0.7	standards
0.3	0.3	around
1	0.5	things
0.7	0.7	that
0.9	0.1	you--you
0.4	1	can
0.7	0.3	and
0.7	0.1	cannot
1	0	say.
0.6	0.3	I--I
0.1	0.2	think
0.2	0.5	you
0.1	0.6	would
0.8	0.2	likely
0.3	0.2	agree
0.4	0.7	with
0.9	0.4	most
0.7	0.5	of
0.2	0.4	them,
0.7	0.6	they--they
0.8	0.3	ban
0.5	0.9	categories
0.4	0.1	of
0.8	0.3	harm
0.1	0.3	such
0.9	0.5	as
0.3	0.2	promoting
0.7	0.7	terrorist
0.7	0.3	propaganda,
0.8	0.1	child
0.6	0.1	exploitation,
0.1	0.1	incitement
0.7	0.6	of
0.1	0.7	violence,
0	0.2	some
0.1	0.9	more
0.9	0.6	legalistic
1	0.7	things
1	0.8	like
0.1	0.7	intellectual
0	0.2	property
0.4	0.3	violations.
0.4	0	And
0.7	0.3	they
0.8	0	also
0.5	0.3	ban
0.4	0	things
0.5	0	like
0.9	0.7	hate
0.4	0.6	speech
0	0.9	that
0.1	0.1	could
1	0.8	lead
0.3	0.8	to
0.1	0.8	dehumanizing
0.1	0.3	people
0.7	0.7	and
0.6	0.9	encouraging
0.1	0.7	violence
0.2	0.6	down
0.4	0.3	the
0.4	0.5	road--
0.4	0.1	
0.5	0.8	
0.5	0.3	SENSENBRENNER:
1	0.5	--If--If
0.9	0.7	I
0.8	0.6	may
0.5	0.9	ask
0.8	0.1	specific
0	0.2	of
1	0.9	you,
0.6	0.5	it
0.9	0.5	was
0.4	0.9	reported
1	0.8	that
0.9	0.5	Donald
0.6	0	Trump
0.7	1	Jr.
0.3	0.1	got
0.9	0.5	taken
0.3	0.1	down
0.4	0.4	for
0.8	0.8	a
0.4	0.7	period
0.4	0.1	of
0.5	0.3	time,
0.1	1	because
0.2	0.9	he
0.5	0.4	put
0.5	0.6	something
0.2	0.7	up
0.1	0.2	on
0.3	0.4	the
0.5	0.2	efficacy
0.9	0.3	of
0.6	0.3	hydroxychloroquine.
0.9	0.2	Now,
0.3	0.6	I
0.8	0.1	wouldn't
0.9	0.5	take
0.6	0.5	it
0.6	0.7	myself,
0.9	1	but
0.6	0.1	there
0.5	0.6	still
0.1	0.4	is
0.9	0.3	a
0.9	0.2	debate
0.6	0.9	on
0.2	0.5	whether
0.2	0.2	it
0.7	0.8	is
0.6	0.4	effective
0.6	0.3	either
0.3	0.9	in
0.8	0.1	treating
0.6	0.5	or
0.3	0.5	preventing
0.6	0.7	COVID-19.
0.6	0.2	And
0.4	0.8	I
1	0.6	think
0.1	0.5	that
0.3	0.4	this
0.3	0.8	is
0.4	0.1	a
0.2	0.8	legitimate
0.3	1	matter
0.8	0.4	of
0.8	0.1	discussion,
0.6	1	and
0.1	0.3	it
0.4	0.4	would
0	1	be
0.1	0.7	up
0.8	0.3	to
0.1	0.7	a
0.2	0.1	patient
0.2	0.6	and
0.6	0.4	their
0.4	0.5	doctor
0.3	0.3	to
0.7	0.4	determine
0.7	0.6	whether
0.2	0.8	hydroxychloroquine
1	0.3	was
0.4	0.1	the
0.8	0.7	correct
0.4	0.5	medication,
0.5	0.1	you
0.1	0.7	know,
0.6	0.1	given
0.4	0.3	the
0.2	0.3	circumstances.
0.2	0.4	Now,
0.1	0.7	why
0.8	0.4	did
0.9	0.4	that
1	0.8	happen?
0	0.9	
0.8	0.4	
0.2	0.1	ZUCKERBERG:
0.1	0.1	Congressman--well,
0.1	0.8	first
0.1	0.6	to
0.3	0.5	be
0.4	0.1	clear,
0.4	0.6	I
1	0.5	think
0.3	0.6	what
0.9	0	you
0.1	0.2	might
0.7	0.2	be
0.9	0.8	referring
0.2	0	to
0.2	0.1	happened
0.9	0.9	on--on
1	0.9	Twitter,
0.8	0.8	so
0.6	0.8	it's
0.4	0.4	hard
0.8	0.1	for
0.7	0.5	me
0.6	0.9	to
0	0.8	speak
0.5	1	to
0.8	1	that.
0.3	0.2	But
0.1	0	I
0.6	0.5	can
0.3	0.2	talk
0.3	0.8	to
0.7	1	our
0.8	0.6	policies
0.7	0.5	about
0.2	0.5	this.
0.5	0.3	We
0.2	0.7	do
0.1	0.6	prohibit
0.1	1	content
0.8	0.4	that
0.8	0.1	will
0.4	0.3	lead
0.6	0.2	to
0.8	0.5	imminent
0.6	0.5	risk
0.5	0.6	of
0.4	0.2	harm.
0.8	0.2	And
0.2	0.9	stating
0.7	0.3	that
0.4	0.7	there
0.2	0.8	is
0.6	0.5	a
0.5	1	proven
0.8	0.3	cure
0	0.8	for
0.1	1	COVID,
0.3	0.7	when
0.4	0.9	there
0.6	0.4	is
0.5	0.5	in
0.3	0.6	fact
0.4	0.9	none--
0.8	1	
0.2	0.2	
1	0	
0.1	0.8	
0.5	0.2	ZUCKERBERG:
0.3	0.3	might
0.9	0.6	encourage
1	0.8	someone
0	0.2	to
0.5	0.1	go
0.4	0.7	take
0.3	0.7	something
0.8	0.3	that
0.1	0.9	could
0.3	0.3	have
0.7	0.4	some
1	0.6	adverse
0.4	0.3	effects.
0	0.1	So
0	0.4	we
0.5	0.7	do
0.8	0.3	take
0.6	0.5	that
0.2	0.3	down.
0.5	0.1	We
0.9	0.9	do
0.7	0.6	not
0	0.1	prohibit
0.8	0.1	discussion
0.4	0.9	around
0.4	0.4	trials
0.8	0.9	of
0.8	1	drugs
0.7	0.7	or--or
0	0.4	people
0	0.5	saying
0.1	1	that
0.2	0.8	they--they
0.6	0.1	think
0.9	0.3	that
0.4	0.2	things
0.2	0.8	might
0.4	0.5	work
0.8	1	or
0.9	0.3	personal
0.3	0.1	experiences
1	0.1	with
0.5	0.8	experimental
0.7	0	drugs.
0.7	0.7	But
0.1	0.8	if
0.2	0.3	someone
0.5	0.7	is
0.5	0.4	going
0.1	0.3	to
0.3	0.5	say
1	0.3	that
0.8	0.7	something
0.1	0.9	is
0.3	0.3	proven
0.7	0.7	when
0.8	0.2	in
0.4	0.8	fact
0.8	0.3	it
0.2	0.2	is
0.3	0.8	not,
1	0.5	that
0.5	0.8	could
0.8	0.1	lead
0.9	0.4	people
0.5	0.1	to
0.1	0.2	make
0.4	0.8	a
0.4	0.8	decision
0.8	0.9	with
0.4	0.5	their
0	1	health--
0.3	0.6	
0.2	0.8	
0.9	0.7	SENSENBRENNER:
0.6	0.2	--But
0	0.7	wouldn't
0	0.4	that
0.8	0.4	be
0.7	0.3	up
0.4	0.7	to
0.5	0.5	somebody
0	0.2	on
0.7	0.9	the
0.5	0.2	other
0	0.5	side
0.4	0.6	of
0.3	0.8	the
0.3	0.1	issue
0.2	0.3	to
0.4	0.7	say
0.6	0.1	that
0.3	0.5	this
0.2	0.3	is
0	0.2	not
0.2	0.1	proven?
1	0.3	And
0.1	1	you
0.4	0.1	know,
0.4	0.5	I
0.9	0.5	know
0.7	0.4	is
0.1	0.4	a
0	0.5	fact
0.3	0.9	that,
0.9	0.7	you
0.7	0.6	know,
0.8	0.5	for
0.2	0.1	people
0.9	0.3	with
0.5	0.9	certain
0.5	0.8	conditions
0.4	0.3	it
0.2	0.1	contraindicated,
0.6	0.7	and
0.6	0	they
0.7	0.3	shouldn't
0.8	0.9	take
0.8	0.1	it
0.4	0.2	on
0.7	0.5	that.
0.4	0	But
0.3	0.3	with
0.2	0.7	not
0.3	0.6	be
0.2	0.6	up
0.4	1	to
0.9	0.3	somebody
0.8	0.8	else,
0	0.3	you
0.8	0.1	know,
0.1	0.6	to
0.8	0.6	say
0.5	0.2	okay,
0	0.7	what
0.8	0.3	somebody
0.4	0.5	posted
0.9	0.2	on
0.3	0.4	this
0.7	0.8	really
0.9	0.8	isn't
0.4	0.7	true
0.3	0.6	and
0.8	0.5	here's
0.4	0.2	what
0.6	0.7	the
0.7	0	facts
0.1	0.6	are
0.9	0.3	rather
0.4	0.8	than
0.3	0.3	having
0.9	0.6	a
0.9	0.3	Twitter
0.4	0.6	or
0.9	0.3	a
0.5	0.2	Facebook
0.1	0.4	take
0.4	0	it
0.8	0.2	down?
0.5	0.6	
0.9	0.5	
0.1	0.3	ZUCKERBERG:
0.4	1	Congressman,
0.5	0.4	in
0.2	0.5	general,
0.8	0.9	I
0.6	0.5	agree
1	0.1	with
0.2	0.6	you
0.8	1	and
0.2	0.1	we
0.7	0.9	do
0.2	0.3	not
0.2	0.4	want
0.3	1	to
0.7	1	become
0.7	0.3	the
0.2	1	arbiters
0.9	0.3	of
0.5	0.3	truth.
0.2	0.4	I
0	0.6	think
1	0.2	that
0.3	0.8	that
0.1	0.8	would
0.2	0.6	be
0.7	0.4	a
0	0.8	bad
0.6	0.5	position
0.7	0.8	for
0.7	0.3	us
0.5	0.7	to
0.5	0.1	be
0.2	0.5	in
0.2	0.6	and
0.7	0.3	not--not
0.8	0.8	what
0.3	0.3	we
0.6	0.5	should
0.7	0.4	be
0.5	0.1	doing.
0.5	0.7	But
0.2	0.3	on
0.5	0	specific
0.7	0.1	claims,
0.6	0.4	if
0.5	0	someone
0.5	0.5	is
0.5	1	going
0.4	0.9	to
0	0.7	go
0.4	0.1	out
0.3	0.6	and
0.1	0.9	say
0.9	0.3	that
0.6	0.6	hydroxychloroquine
0.3	0.6	is
0.8	0.8	proven
0.6	0	to
0.6	0.2	cure
0.7	0.8	COVID
0.3	1	when
0.5	0.3	in

0.7	0.1	to
0.8	0.1	cure
0.2	0.3	COVID
0.3	0.9	and
0.2	1	that
0.7	0.5	that

0.5	0.4	could
0.2	0.1	leave
0.8	0.1	people
0.2	0.5	to

0.6	0.3	a

0.6	0.7	some
0.9	0.8	of

0	1	be
1	0.3	harmful
0.2	0.4	to

0.1	0	we

1	0.9	Mr.
0.2	0.1	Zuckerberg,
0.5	0.6	I
0.6	0.5	want
0.1	0.9	to
0	0.2	thank
0.6	0.8	you
0.7	0.8	for
0	0.3	providing
0.3	0.1	this
0.1	1	information
0.6	0.1	during

0.7	0.9	However,
0	0.7	the
0.2	1	documents
0.6	0.8	you
0	0.5	provided
0.2	0.1	tell
0.7	0.3	a
0.5	0.9	very
0.3	1	disturbing
0.7	0.4	story,
0.7	0.6	and
0.8	0.9	that
0.9	0.3	story
1	0.4	is
0.1	0.7	that
0.6	0.4	Facebook
1	0.8	saw
0	0.3	Instagram
0	0.5	as
0.3	0.3	a
0.7	0.1	powerful
0.5	0.3	threat
0.6	0	that
0.2	0.6	could
0.3	0.3	siphon
0.8	0.3	business
0.7	0.9	away
0.7	0.1	from
1	0.6	Facebook
0.8	0.5	and
0.4	0.5	so
0.6	0.8	rather
0.8	0.2	than
0.1	1	compete
0.2	0.7	with
0.7	0.6	it,
0.4	0.7	Facebook
0.5	0.9	bought
0.8	0.1	it.
0.5	0	This
0.3	0.6	is
0.5	0.5	exactly
0.9	0.1	the
0.6	0.8	type
0	1	of
0.3	0.1	anticompetitive
0.9	0.8	acquisition
0.9	0.2	that
0.1	0.8	the
0.5	0.2	antitrust
0.5	0.6	laws
0.8	0.4	were
0.4	0.7	designed
1	0.7	to
0.5	0.3	prevent.
0.3	0.8	Now,
0.6	0.1	let
0.2	0	me
0.1	0.2	explain
0.6	0.6	what
0.3	0.2	I
0.8	0.7	mean.
0.9	0.5	Mr.
0	0.3	Zuckerberg,
0	0.4	you
0	0.7	have
0.3	0.8	written
0.4	0.3	that
0.6	0.3	Facebook
0.7	0.9	can
0	0.8	likely
0.1	1	always
0.9	0.3	just
0.3	0.3	by
0.2	0.3	anticompetitive
0.2	0.5	startups.
0.4	0.3	In
0.5	0.1	fact,
0.9	0.2	on
0.7	0.6	the
0.7	0.5	day
0.4	0	Facebook
0.3	0.5	bought
0.2	0.8	Instagram,
0.6	1	which
0.9	0.3	you
0.1	0.5	described
0.1	0.8	as
0.4	0.2	a
0.4	0.6	threat,
0.2	0.3	you
0.8	0.5	wrote
0.9	0.3	"One
0.8	0.1	thing
0.3	0.6	about
0.9	0.1	startups
0.6	0.5	is
0.8	0.2	you
0.8	0.9	can
0.4	0.8	often
0.3	0.3	acquire
0.1	0.1	them."
0.7	0.1	Mr.
0.4	0.9	Zuckerberg,
0.9	0.2	you
0.8	0.7	were
0.5	0.5	referring
0.3	0.5	to
0.9	1	companies
0.1	0.1	like
0.5	0	Instagram
0.8	0.7	and
0.3	0.2	that
0.5	0.7	quote,
0.9	0.7	weren't
0.1	0.9	you?
0.4	0.7	
0.5	0.8	
0.2	0.4	ZUCKERBERG:
0.7	0.1	Congressman,
0.8	0.4	I--I
0.8	1	don't
0.3	0.7	have
0.4	0.4	the
0.8	0.6	exact
0.1	0.9	document
0.5	0.2	in
0.5	0.4	front
0.6	0.7	of
0.6	0.5	me,
0.8	0.3	but
0	0.3	I've
0.1	0.5	always
0.4	0.5	been
1	0.9	clear
0.3	0.9	that
0.1	0.3	we
0.2	0.1	viewed
0.7	0.5	Instagram
0.2	0.6	both
0.8	0.8	as
0.5	0.8	a
0.9	0.5	competitor
0.2	0.9	and
0.7	0.4	as
0.1	0.8	a
1	0.1	complement
0.2	0.6	to
0.2	0.3	our
0.6	0.8	services.
0.9	0.3	In
0.5	1	the
0.8	0.5	growing
0.2	0.7	space
0.6	0.8	around--after
0.6	0.6	smartphones
0.6	0.2	start
0.2	0.3	getting
0.2	0.7	big
0.9	0.6	and
0.2	0.1	this--they
0.4	0.3	competed
0.2	0.4	with
0.8	0.1	us
0.7	0.3	in
0.2	0.9	the
0.6	0.8	space
0.4	0.2	of
0.8	0.1	mobile
0.5	0.7	cameras
0.3	0.9	and
0.1	0.8	mobile
0.7	0.6	photo
0.7	0.6	sharing,
0.2	0	but
0.8	0.9	at
0.4	0.1	the
0.2	0.8	time,
0.4	0.6	almost
0.9	0.9	no
0.4	0.7	one
0.3	0.5	thought
0.9	0.2	of
0	1	them
0.1	0.1	as
0.3	0	a
0.1	0.1	general
0.2	0.9	social
0.5	0.3	network
0	0.5	and
0.2	0.6	people
0.1	0.2	didn't
0.1	0.1	think
0.6	1	of
0.4	0.5	them
0.1	0.2	as
0.7	0.4	competing
0.4	1	with
0	0.9	us
0.8	0.6	in
0.9	0.2	that
0.1	0.3	space.
0.3	0.8	And
0.6	0.4	you
0.3	0.7	know,
0.6	0.7	I
0.3	0.7	think
0.8	0.6	that
0.3	0.1	the
0.1	0.9	acquisition
0.7	0.2	has
1	0.8	been
0.3	0.8	wildly
0.1	0.3	successful.
0.3	0.6	We
0.1	0.3	were
0.6	0.1	able
0.8	0.8	to--to
0.3	0.5	by
0.5	0.6	acquiring
0.7	0.4	them
0.7	0.3	continue
0.1	0.4	investing
0.1	0.7	in
0.4	0.2	it
0.1	0.2	and
0.6	0.8	growing
0.3	0.2	it
0.7	1	as
0.8	0.2	a
0.4	0.2	standalone
0.6	0.6	brand
0.9	0.1	than
0.5	0	outrageous
0.8	0.6	many
0.2	0.5	more
0.2	0.9	people
0.5	0.3	than
0.9	0.9	I
0.7	0.3	think
0.6	0.8	either
0.9	0.4	Kevin,
0.1	0.8	the
0.1	0.4	cofounder
0.7	0.2	or
0.2	0.6	I
0.5	0.8	thought
0.3	0	would
0.5	0.6	be
1	0.1	possible
0.5	0.2	at
0.9	0.2	the
0.4	0.8	time
0.6	1	while
0.1	0.6	also
0.7	0.9	incorporating
0.3	0.2	some
0.2	0.4	of
0.9	0.2	the
0.4	0.3	technology
0.2	0.6	into
0.8	0.5	making
0.2	0.1	Facebook's
0.5	0.5	photos
0.7	0.6	sharing
0.5	0.1	products
0.8	0.4	better.
0.8	0.1	So--so
0.1	0.3	yes.
0.8	0.5	
0.8	0.3	
0.6	0.5	NADLER:
0	0.7	Okay.
0.7	0.8	Now,
0.5	0.2	in
0.4	0.1	early
0.8	0.9	2012
0.5	0.5	when
0.5	0.9	Facebook
1	0.4	contemplated
0.9	1	acquiring
0.6	0.3	Instagram,
0.8	0.8	a
0.3	0.5	competitive
0.9	0.6	startup,
0.2	0.7	you
0	0.8	told
0.5	0.8	your
0.7	0.5	CFO
0.8	0.5	that,
1	0.3	though
0.1	0.3	nascent,
0.8	0.7	Instagram
0.7	0.6	could
0.3	0.5	be
0	0.9	very
0.4	0.1	disruptive
0.7	0.8	to
0	0.2	us
0.4	0.4	and
0.5	0.7	in
0.7	0.9	the
0.2	0.8	weeks
0.3	1	leading
0.6	0.8	up
0.2	0.1	to
0.5	0.9	the
0.9	0.6	deal,
0.8	0.9	you
0.2	0.9	described
0.8	0.1	Instagram
0.3	0.4	as
0.4	0.8	a
0.6	0.1	threat
0.3	0	saying
0.8	1	that
0.9	0.6	"Instagram
0.9	0.5	can
0.1	0.6	meaningfully
0.1	0.7	hurt
0.6	0.9	us
0.6	0.5	without
0.2	0.9	becoming
0.2	0.9	a
0.2	1	huge
0.2	0.3	business."
1	0.9	Now
0.8	0.5	Mr.
0.3	0.8	Zuckerberg,
0.3	0.4	what
0.9	0.3	did
0.9	0.1	you
0.2	0.2	mean
0.4	1	when
0.1	0.9	you
0.8	0.9	described
0.9	0.1	Instagram
0.2	0.8	as
0.9	0.1	a
0.5	0.9	threat,
0.2	0.1	as
0.6	0.7	disruptive
0.8	0.9	and
0.3	0.3	when
0.4	0.6	you
0.6	0.1	said
0.6	0.4	that
0.1	0.8	Instagram
0.5	0.4	could
0.5	0.5	meaningfully
1	0.3	hurt
0.9	0.8	Facebook?
0.5	0.3	Did
0.2	0.7	you
0.4	0.5	mean
0.6	0.1	that
0.2	0.3	Instagram--that
1	0.9	consumers--did
0.1	0.6	you
0.7	0.4	mean
0.6	0.3	that
0.4	1	consumers
0.8	0.3	might
0.8	0	switch
0.6	0.4	from
0.9	1	Facebook
0.8	0.9	to
0.6	0	Instagram?
1	0.6	
0.2	0.6	
0.3	0.2	ZUCKERBERG:
0.4	0.9	Congressman,
0.6	0.7	thanks
0.5	0.4	for
0.9	0.5	the--the
0.4	0.8	opportunity

0.5	0.8	address
0.8	0.1	this.
0	0.4	At
0.9	0.2	the
0.2	0.7	time,
0.5	0.1	there
0.8	0.7	was
0.9	0.4	a
0.6	0.2	small
0.9	0.6	but
0.7	0.7	growing
0.2	0.1	field
0.2	0.5	of--
0.8	0.7	
0.7	0.3	
0.3	0.5	NADLER:
0.1	0.5	--Did
0.8	0.8	you
0.6	0.1	mean--did

0.4	0.2	mean
0.4	0	that

0.3	0.8	from
0.7	0.4	Facebook
0.1	0.4	to
0.9	0.3	Instagram?
0.9	0.5	That
0.7	0.5	was
0.3	0.3	my
0.7	0.5	question.
0.1	0.5	
0.7	0.3	
0.9	0.5	ZUCKERBERG:
0.3	0.8	--Thanks.

0.9	0.2	NADLER:
0.1	0.7	--Yes
0.2	0.2	or
0.7	0.8	no,
0.5	0.3	did
0.7	0.2	you
0.1	0.7	mean
0.2	0.6	that?
0.2	1	
0.2	0	
0.4	0.5	ZUCKERBERG:
0.6	0.7	In
0.2	0.3	the
0.4	0.9	space
0.8	0	of
0.1	0.4	mobile
0.5	0.6	photos
0.4	0.2	and--and
0.1	0.5	camera
0.2	0.9	apps,
0.9	0.3	which
0.3	0.5	was
0.4	0.2	growing,
0.8	0.5	they
1	0	were
0.7	0	a
0.8	0.4	competitor.
0.7	0.9	I've
0.1	0.1	been--I've
0.3	0.3	been
0.2	0.8	clear
0.2	0.7	about
1	0.4	that
0.1	0	and--
0.4	0.1	
0.6	1	
0.5	0.4	NADLER:
0.1	0.8	--Okay,
0.9	0.7	fine.
0.8	0	Fine.
0.9	0.5	In
0.7	0.8	February
0.1	0.4	of
0.9	0.8	that
0.3	0.5	year,
0.6	0.1	February
0.1	0.4	2012,
0.7	0.6	you
0.8	0.4	told
0.6	0.3	Facebook's
0.1	0.5	chief
0.1	0.1	financial
0.9	0.3	officer
0	0.2	that
0.2	0.9	you
0.1	0.5	were
0.8	0.1	interested
0.9	0.9	in
0.2	0.1	buying
0.7	0.3	Instagram.
1	0.7	He
0.9	0	asked
0.7	0.8	you
0.3	0.9	whether
0.6	0.2	the
0.3	0.6	purpose
0.1	0.4	of
0.2	0.2	the
0.5	0	deal
0.5	0.1	was
0.7	0.9	to
0	0.6	neutralize
0.5	0.9	a
0.7	0.7	potential
0.5	0.7	competitor
0.3	0.1	or
0.6	0.7	to
0.4	0.8	integrate
0.6	0.9	their
0.1	0.4	products
0.5	0.3	with
0	1	hours
0.7	1	in
0.7	0.7	order
0.6	0.4	to
0.7	0.5	improve
0.1	0.9	our
0.2	0.1	services.
0.8	0.9	You
0.1	0.7	answered
0.8	0.9	that
0.3	0.6	it
0.3	0.9	was
0.1	0	a
0.1	0.5	combination
0.8	0.4	of
0.9	0	both
0.9	0.1	saying
0.8	0.4	what
0	0.7	we
0.9	0.5	are
0.9	0.8	really
0.1	0.9	buying
0.6	0.7	is
0.1	0.6	time.
0.2	0.8	Even
0.6	0.2	of
0.9	0.8	new
0.9	0.3	some
0.8	0.2	new
0.8	0.8	competitors
0.2	0.3	springs--springs
0.5	0.7	outcome
0.1	0.1	of
0.4	0.8	those
0.3	0.6	products
0.6	0.5	won't
0.9	0.4	get
0.1	0.9	much
0.4	0.4	traction
0.4	0.8	since
0	0.9	will
0.8	0.7	already
0.9	0.8	have
0.3	0.8	the
0.5	0.9	mechanics
0.7	0.2	deployed
0	0.1	at
0.5	0.1	scale.
0	0.1	Mr.
0.2	0.9	Zuckerberg,
0.3	0.9	what
0.7	0.2	did
0.1	0.7	you
0.3	0.9	mean
0.5	0.2	when
0.3	0.3	you
0.1	0	answered
0.7	0.1	that
0.3	0.5	the
1	0.5	purpose
0.9	0.8	of
0.7	0.7	the
0.8	0.1	deal
0.1	0.6	was
0.8	0.7	to
0.1	0.6	neutralize
0.1	0.6	a
0.8	0.2	potential
0.8	0.5	competitor?
0.7	0.7	
0.7	0.7	
0.1	0.4	ZUCKERBERG:
0.5	0.7	Congressman,
0.6	1	will,
0.1	0.2	those
0.7	0.5	aren't
0.5	0.3	my
0.9	0.2	words
0.6	0.8	but
0.1	0.3	yes
0.5	0.7	I've
0.7	0.7	been
0.9	0.8	clear
0.2	0.6	that
0.8	0.2	Instagram
0.1	0.4	was
0.1	0.9	a
0.1	0.5	competitor
0.4	0.2	in
0.8	0.5	the
0.6	0.9	space
0.6	1	of
0.6	0.8	mobile
0.8	0.1	photo
0.9	0.8	sharing.
0.6	0.2	There
0.7	0.3	were
0.5	0.3	a
0.5	0.8	lot
0.2	0.8	of
0.2	0.1	others
0.5	1	at
0.3	0.7	the
0.1	0.5	time.
0.3	0.1	They
1	0.9	competed
0.5	0.3	with
0.1	0.6	apps
0.3	0.8	like
0.4	0.5	VSCO
0.9	0.5	Cam
0.7	0.8	and
0.5	1	Pick
0.3	0.6	Please
0.2	0.8	(SP)
0.6	0.7	and
0.8	0.5	companies
0.1	0.3	like
0.6	0.5	Path.
0.2	0.1	It--it
0.9	0.5	was
0.4	0.7	a--a
0.7	0.9	subset
0	0.3	of
0.7	0.1	the
0.9	0.5	overall
0.8	0.1	space
0.5	0.2	of
0.4	0.5	connecting
0.7	1	that
0.3	0.4	we
0.6	0	exist
0.1	0.1	in
0.2	0.5	and
0.6	1	by
0.2	0.3	having
0.4	0.8	them
0.5	0.1	join
0.5	0.3	us,
0.7	0.5	they
0.5	0.3	certainly
0.9	0.4	went
0.6	0.2	from
0.5	0.9	being
1	0.6	a
0.4	0.1	competitor
0.4	0.3	in
0.6	0.6	the
0.6	0.4	space
0.6	0.3	of
0.9	0.8	being
0	0.3	a
0.6	0.5	mobile
0.1	0.2	camera
0.9	0.2	to
0.6	0.7	an
1	0.5	app
0.5	0.8	that
0.7	0.7	we
0.1	0	could
0.7	0.4	help
0.1	0.6	grow
0.1	0.1	and
0.6	0.7	help
0.7	0.4	get
0.9	0.2	more
1	0.8	people
0.2	0.3	to
0.9	0.3	be
0.8	0.5	able
0.2	0.7	to

0.2	0.1	and
0	0.9	be
0.3	0.6	on
0.9	0.3	our
0.3	0.4	team.
0.2	0.8	And
0.3	0.1	I
0.6	0.6	think
0.6	0.7	that
0.5	0.1	that's
0.2	0.6	been--
0.2	0.7	
0.6	0.5	
0.3	0.6	NADLER:
0.7	0.5	--Thank
0.7	0.2	you--thank
0.1	0	you
0.8	0.7	for
0.7	0.6	your
0.9	0.9	time--
0.8	0.6	
1	0.1	
0.9	0.3	ZUCKERBERG:
0.9	0.5	--Wildly
0.3	0.1	successful.
0.5	0.6	
0.6	0.3	
0.7	0.1	NADLER:
0.1	0.1	Well,
0.6	0.5	Mr.
0.7	0.8	Zuckerberg,
0.3	0.5	mergers
0.5	0.9	and
0.9	0.2	acquisitions
0.9	0.6	that
0.8	0.3	buy
0.8	0.1	off
0.6	0.8	potential
0.2	0.9	competitive
0.1	0.1	threats
0.6	0.6	violate
1	0.5	the
0	0.5	antitrust
0.9	0.5	laws.
0.5	0.6	In
0.8	0.5	your
0.2	0.8	own
0	1	words,
0.7	0.9	you
0.3	0.5	purchased
0.6	0.4	Instagram
1	0.8	to
0.6	0.6	neutralize
0.9	0.1	a
0.2	0.9	competitive
0.3	0.9	threat.
0.7	0.1	If
0.3	0	this
0.4	0.3	was
0.7	0.4	an
0.9	0.9	illegal
0.3	0.7	merger
0.9	0.9	at
0.5	0.3	the
0.9	0.1	time
0.6	0.1	of
0.2	0.1	the
0.5	0.7	transaction,
0.3	0.5	why
0.6	0.9	shouldn't
0.2	0.2	Instagram
0.1	0.2	now
0.7	0.7	be
0.6	0.3	broken
0.6	0.8	off
0.8	0.4	into
0.8	0.8	a
0.9	0.4	separate
0.7	0.2	company?
0.1	0.4	
0.9	0.5	
1	0.4	ZUCKERBERG:
0.4	0.3	Well
0.3	0.3	congressman,
0.8	0.5	I
0.8	0.2	think
0.4	0.5	the
0.2	0.1	FTC
0.2	0.7	had
0.2	0	all
0.3	0.3	of
0.1	0.1	these
0.9	0.3	documents
0.7	0.6	and
0.6	0.2	reviewed
0.7	0.2	this
0.6	0.8	and
0.7	0.9	unanimously
0.4	0.2	voted
0	0	at
0.1	0.8	the
0.6	0	time
0.7	0.6	not
0.9	0.9	to
0.1	0.2	challenge
0.1	1	the
0.4	0.2	acquisition.
0.1	0.1	I
0.2	0.5	think
0.5	0.5	with
0.2	0.1	hindsight,
0.7	1	it
0.6	0.8	probably
0.6	0.1	looks
0.7	0.1	like
0.4	0.3	obvious
0.1	0.1	that
0.3	0.6	Instagram
0	0.1	would
0.9	0.8	have
0.9	0.6	reached
0.9	0.3	the
0.9	0.1	scale
0.9	0.8	that
0.6	0.6	it
0.1	0.6	has
0.5	0.4	today
0.4	0.3	but
0.6	0.8	at
0.6	0.1	the
0.1	0.3	time,
0.5	0.7	it
0.8	0.3	was
1	0.5	far
0.3	0.9	from
0.3	0.7	obvious.
0.4	0.1	A
0.8	0.4	lot
0.7	0.8	of
0.8	0.2	the
0.3	0.8	competitors
0.6	0.5	that
0.6	0.8	they
0.9	0.9	competed
0.2	0.9	with
0.4	0.4	in
0.4	0.8	mobile
0.8	0.2	sharing
0.9	0.8	including
0.9	0.1	companies
0.3	0.6	like
0.7	0.4	Path,
0.8	0.5	which
0.5	0.9	were
0.8	0	hot
0.2	0.4	at
0.3	0.5	the
0.1	0.7	time
0.2	1	and
0.9	0.3	had
0.1	0.8	great
0.4	0.4	founders
0.3	0.3	and
0.9	0.6	entrepreneurs
0.5	0.4	running
0.3	0.1	them,
0.5	0.7	Dave
0.7	0.1	Moore
0.5	0.9	and
0.4	0.7	I
0.1	0.3	worked
0.6	0.5	closely
0.5	0.2	with
0.4	0.6	him.
0.7	0.7	I
0.6	0.5	mean,
0.9	0.4	I
0.8	0.1	don't
0.1	0.4	even
0.4	0.6	think
0.4	0	Path
0.2	0.9	existed.
0.4	0.3	It
0.3	0.8	was
0.9	0.4	not
0.7	0.1	a
0.9	0.1	guarantee
0.3	0.8	that
0.9	0.9	Instagram
0.6	0.8	was
0.3	0	going
0.5	0.1	to
0.7	0.7	succeed.
0.4	0.4	The
0.2	1	acquisition
0.5	0.2	has
0.1	0.7	done
0.9	0.1	wildly
0.5	0.1	well
0.4	0.1	largely
0.6	0.3	because
0.1	0.2	not
0.8	0.8	just
0.3	0.1	of
0.5	0.6	the
0.9	0.8	founder's
0.1	0.5	talent,
0.5	0.3	but
0.9	0.4	because
0.6	0.6	we
0.5	0.5	invested
1	0.9	heavily
0.6	0.6	in
0.9	0.9	building
0.6	0.3	up
0.3	0.3	the
0.9	0.1	infrastructure
0.1	0.3	and
0.9	0.7	promoting
0.3	0.5	it
0.5	0.2	and
0.7	0.1	working
0.8	0.4	on
0	0.8	security
0.7	0.3	and
0.1	0.7	working
0.8	0.5	on
0	0.3	a
0.3	1	lot
0.4	0.1	of
0.8	0.9	things
0	0.2	around
0.8	0.6	this.
0	0.1	And
0.4	0	I
1	0.5	think
0.2	0.2	that
0.1	0.5	this
1	0.4	has
0.2	0.5	been
0	0.1	an
0.9	0.8	amazing
0.7	0.2	success
0.8	0.1	story.
0	0.6	
0	0.4	
0.8	0.7	NADLER:
0.3	0.7	Well,
0.6	0.1	thank
0.6	0.9	you.
0.9	0.7	Mr.
1	0.3	Zuckerberg,
0.1	0.6	you're
1	0.9	making
0.5	0.9	my
0.9	0.5	point.
0.7	0.7	In
0.2	0.3	closing,
0.7	0.5	Mr.
0.8	0.3	Chairman,
0.8	0.5	I
0.9	0.3	wanted
0.8	0.3	to
0.9	0.1	end
0.1	0	where
0.3	0.9	I
0.6	0.5	began.
0.1	0.8	Facebook,
0.4	0.3	by
0.9	0	Mr.
0.3	0.8	Zuckerberg's
0.4	0.8	own
1	0.8	admission
0.3	0.1	and
0.6	0.3	by
0.2	0.4	the
0.5	0	documents
0.9	0.8	we
0	0.6	have
0.8	0.5	from
0.3	0.9	the
0.4	0.6	time,
0.7	0.5	Facebook
0.4	0.2	saw
0.5	0.3	Instagram
0.8	0.6	as
0.2	0.3	a
0.8	0.4	threat
0.3	0.5	that
0.1	0.9	could
0.7	0.5	potentially
0.7	0.5	siphon
0.8	0.2	business
0.6	0.4	away
0.4	0.3	from
0.8	1	Facebook
0.3	0.5	and
0.2	0.1	so
1	0.4	rather
1	0.2	than
0.7	0.8	compete
0.5	0.9	with
0.3	0.4	it,
0.8	0.1	Facebook
0.8	0.8	bought
1	0.4	it.
0.4	0.3	This
0.2	0.1	is
0.7	0.8	exactly
0.1	0.3	the
0	0.1	type
0	0.7	of
0.8	0.6	anticompetitive
0.6	0.2	acquisition
0.5	0.3	that
0.1	0.7	the
1	0.6	antitrust
0.5	0.3	laws
0.5	0.6	were
0.7	1	designed
0.1	0.6	to
0.1	0.5	prevent.
0.2	0.6	This
1	0.3	should
0.1	0.6	never
0.3	0.8	have
0.1	0.8	happened
0.1	0.7	in
0	0.2	the
0	0.1	first
0.4	0.1	place.
0.2	0.8	It
0.2	0.7	should
0.3	0.3	never
0.2	0.7	have
0.5	0.8	been
0.3	0.9	permitted
0.7	0.8	to
0.6	0.3	happen
0.1	0.4	and
0.8	0.8	it
0.7	0.4	cannot
0.6	0.7	happen
0.9	0.5	again.
0.6	0.4	I
0.3	0.9	yield
0.3	0.7	back.
0.5	0.9	
0	0.8	
0.6	0.8	CICILLINE:
1	0.9	Thank
0.9	1	you,
0.6	0.6	Mr.
0.5	0.6	Chairman.
0.8	0.7	I
1	0.8	would
0.6	0.5	remind
0.9	0.1	the
0.9	0	witness
0.6	1	that
0.7	0.9	the
0.9	0.3	failures
0.5	0.3	of
0.3	1	the
0.1	0.2	FTC
0.4	0.9	in
0.3	0.3	2012
0.1	0.2	of
0.7	0.9	course
0.1	0	do
0.8	0.6	not
0	0.5	alleviate
0.1	0.3	the
0.7	0.8	antitrust
0.2	0.7	challenges
0.4	0.7	that
0	1	the
0.6	0.2	chairman
0.8	0.7	described.
0.3	0.4	And
0.9	0.4	with
0.9	0.9	that,
0.5	0.6	I'm
0.9	0.9	going
0.2	0	to
0.7	0.6	recognize
0.4	0.1	the
0.9	0.3	gentleman
0.1	0.1	from
0.1	0.2	Colorado
0.5	0.8	and
0.6	0.5	again
0.4	0.4	thank
0.2	0.9	him
0.1	0.3	for
0.9	0.5	cohosting
0.8	0.5	one
0.1	0.7	of
0.2	0.2	the
0.9	0.8	most
0.8	0.5	important
0.9	0.6	field
0.5	0.1	hearings
0.4	0.2	we
0.1	0.1	had
0.2	0.1	along
0.3	0.8	with
0.6	0.3	Mr.
0.7	0.8	Neguse
0.7	0.1	in
0.9	1	Colorado
0.4	0.8	and
0.3	0.3	I
0.4	0.7	think
0.2	0.5	was
0.6	0.5	very
0.5	0.6	critical
0.7	1	in
0.3	0.3	this
0.3	0.3	investigation.
0.8	0.6	You
1	0.3	recognized
0.8	0.7	for
0.1	0.4	five
0.9	0.1	minutes,
0.5	0.3	Mr.
0.5	0.1	Buck.
0.4	0.1	
0.6	0.3	
0.8	0.9	BUCK:
0.8	0.6	Thank
0.2	0.3	you,
0.8	0.6	Mr.
0.3	0.4	Chairman.
0.2	0.7	And
0.7	0.2	I
0.1	0.5	want
0.9	0.3	to
0	0.9	offer
0.6	0.9	my
0.9	0.7	appreciation
0.6	0	to
0.8	0.4	you
0.8	0.2	for
0.7	0.5	the
0.2	0.3	bipartisan
0.3	0.9	way
0.5	1	that
0.8	0.9	you
0.2	0.1	have
0.6	0.4	approached
0.3	0.5	the
1	0.7	subcommittee's
0.4	0	investigation.
0.4	0.4	I
1	0.8	want
0.8	0.9	to
0.8	0.2	start
0.8	0.1	by
0.7	0.6	saying
0.3	0.2	that
0.2	0	capitalism
0.2	0.9	it
0.5	0.7	is
0.1	0.2	the
0.3	0.1	greatest
0.5	0.7	instrument
0	0.7	for
0.2	0.2	freedom
0.5	0.3	this
0.7	0.2	world
0.1	0.8	has
0.3	0.9	ever
0.8	0.7	seen.
0.3	0.1	Capitalism
0.5	0.4	has
0.5	0.7	given
0	1	the
0.2	0.3	United
0.3	0.6	States
0.5	0.1	the
0.8	0.3	freedom
0.8	0.6	and
0	0.4	means
0.3	0.9	to
0.5	0.2	defeat
0.2	0.7	the
0.4	0.2	Soviet
0.4	0.1	Union,
0.8	0.2	beat
0.8	0.8	back
0.9	0.9	Fascism,
0.7	0.7	and
0.3	0.8	put
0.9	0.1	a
0.6	0.6	man
0.9	0.1	on
0.6	0.6	the
0.5	0.7	moon.
0.8	0.5	This
0.7	0.3	economic
0.1	0.6	system
0.1	1	has
0.6	0.5	lifted
0.1	0	millions
0.6	0.1	out
0.1	0.5	of
0.2	0.5	poverty.
0.7	0.1	It
0	0.6	has
0.8	0.2	made
0.5	0.9	America
0.3	0.4	the
0.9	1	freest,
0.2	0.3	most
0.1	0.5	prosperous
0.2	0.7	nation
0.4	0	in
1	0.3	the
0.5	0.2	world.
0.2	0.1	Our
0.8	0.7	witnesses
0.5	0.9	have
0.7	0.7	taken
0.4	0.8	ideas
0.8	0.1	born
0.9	0.7	out
0.3	0.2	of
0.1	0.1	the
0.7	0.3	dorm
0.6	0.5	room,
0.1	0.2	garage,
0.9	0.2	eye
0.6	0.1	warehouse
0.9	0.6	and
0.5	1	built
0.6	0.9	these
0.8	0.9	dreams
0.7	0.1	into
0	0.1	four
0.8	0.2	of
0	1	the
0	0	biggest
0.2	0	power
0.5	0.2	players
0.4	0.8	in
0.8	0.2	the
0.2	0.4	digital
0.3	1	global
0.6	0.5	economy.
0.1	0.2	You
0.9	0.5	have
0.6	0.7	all
0.1	0.1	enjoyed
0.9	0.2	the
0.3	0	freedom
0.7	0.3	to
0.7	0.9	succeed.
0.8	0.2	Now,
0.2	0.1	let
0.9	0.8	me
0.5	0.6	be
0.1	0.6	clear,
0.5	0.1	I
0.4	0.7	do
0.7	0.5	not
0.7	0.6	believe
0.3	0.2	big
0.1	0.1	is
0.4	0.9	necessarily
0.1	0.8	bad.
0.9	0.3	In
0.2	0.5	fact,
0.5	0.3	big
0.9	0.8	is
0.8	0.5	often
0.4	0.2	a
0.3	0.1	force
0.4	1	for
0.9	0.8	good.
0.8	0.9	However,
0.2	0.6	I
0.9	0.5	want
1	0.6	to
0.8	0.4	address
0.2	0.3	one
0.8	0.2	particularly
0	0.5	disturbing
0.3	0.5	issue.
0.1	0.5	Mr.
0.6	0.3	Pichai,
0.2	0.3	in
0.8	0.4	October
0.1	0.4	2018,
0.3	0.8	Google
0.4	0.1	dropped
0.7	0.3	out
0.1	0.1	of
0.5	0.7	the
0.8	0.7	running
0.1	0.1	for
0.6	0.2	a
0.6	0.2	Pentagon
0.6	0.2	contract
0.5	0.3	to
1	0.2	complete
0.8	0.8	the
0.3	0.8	Joint
0.3	0.7	Enterprise
0.1	0.3	Defense
0.2	0.6	Infrastructure,
0.9	0.3	or
0.9	0.1	JEDI
0.2	0.5	contract,
0.9	0.4	which
0.5	0.8	was
0.9	0.3	valued
0.6	0.9	at
0.4	0.8	more
0.4	0.8	than
0.4	0.8	$10
0.6	0	billion.
0.1	0.2	Google's
0.9	0	stated
0.4	0.8	reason
0.6	1	for
0.9	0.4	removing
0.6	0.5	itself
0.2	0.5	from
0.7	0	the
0.9	0.5	bidding
0.4	0.9	process
0.9	0.2	is
0.4	0.6	that
0.2	0.7	the
0.7	0.1	U.S.
0.9	0.6	military's
0.9	0.6	project
0.5	0.8	did
0.8	0.2	not
0.3	0.9	align
0.4	0.9	with
0.7	0.4	Google's
0.2	0.9	corporate
0.3	0.8	values
0.5	0.4	and
0.9	0	principles.
0.2	0.7	This
0.7	0.3	is
0.1	0.2	that
0.9	0.9	same
0.1	0.6	U.S.
0.3	0.1	military
0.7	0.9	that
0.6	0.3	fights
1	0.1	for
0.5	0.5	our
0.5	0.7	freedoms
0.4	0.2	and
0.9	0.8	stands
1	0.1	as
0.4	0.5	a
0.1	0.2	force
0.2	0.6	for
1	0.5	good
0.8	0.6	across
0.8	0.6	the
0.2	0.8	globe.
0.6	0.2	These
0.5	0.4	are
0	0.2	the
0.1	0.7	same
0.7	0.1	soldiers,
0.9	0	sailors--sailors
1	0	and
0.6	0.7	airmen
0.1	0.9	that
0.3	0.7	sacrificed
0.5	0.9	their
0.7	0.2	lives
1	0.3	to
0.4	0.4	ensure
0.5	0.8	you
0	0.9	have
0.3	1	the
0	1	freedom
0.1	0.1	to
0.4	0.6	build
0	0.4	your
0.1	0.1	company
0.1	0.4	and
0.1	0.3	set
0.2	0	your
0	0.5	corporate
0.3	0.4	policies
0.8	0.5	without
0.1	0.2	fear
0.5	0.6	of
0.5	1	government
0.1	0.1	interference,
0.7	0.5	unlike
0.3	0.4	in
0.6	0.1	communist
0.4	0.6	China.
0.2	0.4	I
0.4	0.1	also
0.4	0.3	find
0.8	0.1	it
0.5	0.5	very
0.7	0.6	interesting
1	0.8	that
1	0.5	only
0.3	0.8	months
0	0.1	after
0.4	0.7	making
1	0	this
0.3	0.7	decision
0.6	0	to
0.6	0.2	withdraw
0.7	0.3	from
0.3	0.9	the
0.3	0.6	JEDI
0.7	0.3	contract,
0.1	0.1	Marine
0.8	0.7	General
0.7	0.4	Joseph
0.6	0.2	Dunford,
0	0.3	the
1	0.4	chairman

0.8	0.4	U.S.
0.4	0.7	Joint

0.3	0.4	
0.5	0.5	
0.4	0.3	
0.4	0.4	
0.1	1	BUCK:
0.1	0.4	warned
0.4	0.2	the
0.4	0.6	Senate
0.4	0.8	Armed
0.3	0.8	Forces
0.7	1	Committee
0.8	0.6	that
0.7	0.7	the
1	0.7	Chinese
0.3	0.8	military
0.6	0.1	was
0.4	0	directly
0.7	0.6	benefiting
0	0.8	from
0.8	0	Google's
0.2	0.6	work.
0.8	0.9	It
0	0.5	made
0.4	0.4	me
1	0.6	wonder
1	0.9	what
0.2	0.4	values
0.1	0.2	Google
0.5	0.2	and
0.5	0.9	Communist
0.2	0.1	Red
1	0	China
0.5	0.9	had
0.6	0.6	in
0.6	0.6	common.
0.4	0.1	I
0.2	0.5	asked
0.9	1	myself,
0.5	0.8	self,
0.5	1	is
0.6	0.7	it
0.1	0.4	that
0.5	0.3	the
0.7	0.4	Chinese
0.4	0.3	Communist
0.4	0.3	Party
0.8	0.7	imprisons
0.9	0.6	Uyghur
1	0.2	Muslims
0.7	1	in
0.7	0.3	concentration
0.7	0	camp?
0.2	0.9	I--it
1	0.2	is
1	0.9	shown
0.5	0.5	on
0.1	0.7	the
0.7	0.4	chart
0.9	0.5	behind
0.5	0.3	me.
0.7	0.9	Could
0.9	0.4	it
0.3	0.3	be
0.5	0.1	that
0.1	0.9	China
0.9	0.7	forces
0.2	0.5	slaves
0.9	0.7	to
0	0.5	work
1	0.6	in
0.7	0.6	sweatshops?
0.4	0.1	Maybe
0.5	0.6	they
0.1	0.9	align
0.3	0.3	on
0.3	0.7	the
0.5	0.9	design
0.5	0.3	to
0.5	0.4	suppress
0.3	0.6	free
0.6	0.9	speech
0.4	0.1	in
0.1	0.6	Hong
0.4	0.3	Kong.
0.9	0.2	Did
0.3	0.2	Google
0.2	0.3	agree
0.5	1	with
0.8	0.7	CCP's
0.2	0.8	decision
0.8	0.2	to
0.5	0.5	lie
0.1	0.1	to
0.1	0.4	the
0.3	0.6	world
0.3	0.4	about
0.6	0.4	the
0.4	1	COVID-19
0.3	0.1	pandemic?
0.1	0.7	Then
0.6	0.3	I
0.3	0.2	thought
0.6	0.7	about
0.1	0.9	Google's
0.3	0.5	Dragon
0.5	0.5	Fly
0.8	0.8	experiment.
0.5	0.7	I
0.3	0.8	wondered
0.7	0.9	if
0.3	0.1	perhaps
0.2	0.3	you
0	0.7	agreed
0.3	0.2	with
0.4	0	the
0.2	0.5	Chinese
0.8	0.4	government's
0.7	0.6	use
0.9	0.9	of
0	0.2	technology
0	0.2	platforms
0.5	0.8	to
0.4	0.8	spy
0.1	0.7	on
0.4	0.3	its
0.5	0.9	own
0.8	1	people
0.4	0.1	and
0.8	0.6	enforce
0.6	0.3	Draconian
1	0.9	security
0.6	0.5	laws.
0.4	0.5	Maybe
0.2	0.8	it's
1	0.2	that
0.2	0.2	your
0.3	0	company
0.2	0.7	is
0.2	0.8	aligned
0	0.3	with
0.3	0.8	the
0.2	1	Chines
0.3	0.6	Communist
0.7	0.4	Party's
0.1	0.2	corporate
0.7	0.2	espionage
0.1	0.9	policies,
0.7	0.4	where
0.9	0.2	the
0.5	0.6	strategy
0.6	0.7	is
0.2	0.7	to
0.7	0.1	steal
0.2	0.7	whatever
0.7	0.2	can't
0.9	0.7	be
0.8	0.2	produced
1	0.5	domestically.
0.8	0.3	These
0.7	0.6	values
0.6	0.6	that
1	0.1	allow
0.8	0	Google
0.3	0.8	to
0	0.1	work
0.4	0.2	with
0.8	0.4	the
0.1	0.5	Chinese
0.3	0	military
0.4	0.3	but
0.8	0.3	not
0.4	0.6	the
0.2	0.2	U.S.
0.5	0.3	military
0	0.3	explain
0.3	0.7	why
0.8	0.6	Google
0.8	0.4	wouldn't
0.2	0.4	think
0.1	0.5	twice
0.9	1	about
0.6	0.2	blatantly
0	0.8	stealing
0.3	0.9	a
0.3	0.3	competitor's
0.3	0.4	product,
0.9	0.5	right
0.8	0.4	down
0.3	0.9	to
0.3	0.6	the
0.1	0.6	watermark
0.6	0.7	without
0.7	0.4	any
0.1	0.4	hint
0	0.5	of

0.8	0.4	Mr.
0	0.5	Pichai,
0.4	0.6	during

0.8	0	I
0.3	0.8	heard

0.8	0.6	that
0.4	0.7	sounded
0.3	0.7	so
0.7	0.1	brazen
0.4	0.3	and
0.9	0.2	contrary

0.4	0.4	principles,
0.5	0.2	that
0.7	0.2	I

0.3	0	it

0.9	0.3	been
0.1	0.1	straight
0.4	0.6	from

0.2	0.4	Communist
0.5	0.8	Party's
0.1	0.3	corporate
0.5	1	espionage
0.8	0.8	playbook.
0.7	0.9	Google

0.5	0.2	advantage
0.6	0.8	of
0.5	0	a

0.7	0.9	Google

0.8	0.4	After

0.5	0.6	It's

0.8	0.9	rapid
0.4	0.2	spread
0.9	0.4	of
0.9	0.1	hate
0.7	0.4	messages
0.6	0.6	online,
0.4	0.4	the
1	0.8	presence
0.5	0.5	of
0.5	0.9	Boogaloo
0.5	0.3	and
0	0.7	other
0.6	0.1	right
0.3	0.8	wing
0.1	0.5	extremist
0.3	1	groups
0.2	0.7	trying

0.2	0.6	disrupt
0.6	1	Black
0.7	0.2	Lives
0.5	0.8	Matter
0.3	0.9	protests
0.5	0.6	and
0.8	0.9	the

0.4	0.1	that
0.4	0.9	white
0.2	0.6	racist
0	0.1	and
0.7	0.3	anti-somatic
0.1	0.2	content
0.6	0.6	flourishes
0.1	0.4	on

0.4	0.3	So
0.6	0.3	they're
0.9	0.5	asking
0.6	0.3	you
0.9	0.1	to
0.5	0.7	remove
0.6	0.4	these
0.6	0.6	pictures
0.7	0.5	and
0.9	0.6	essentially
0.1	1	to

0.9	0.5	for
0.1	0.3	civil

0.5	0.3	by
0.7	0.9	not
0.4	0.2	allowing
0.2	0.3	that
0	0.1	kind
0.2	0.8	of
0.6	0.2	content.
0.4	0.2	They
0.2	0.9	are--their
0.6	0.2	breakwaters
0.1	0	include
0.4	0.8	a
0.4	0.5	lot
0.8	0.1	of
0.2	0.6	big

0.8	0.7	including

0.7	0.3	so
0.1	0.5	on.
0.5	0.9	But
0.6	0.4	you
0.4	0.9	seem
0.4	0.8	not

0.9	0.9	that
0.3	1	moved
0.3	0.9	by
0.7	0.2	their

0.4	0.1	I
0.7	0.8	just
0.3	0.3	wondered
0.3	0.6	what
0.9	0.5	you
0.7	0.5	think
0.9	0.8	about
0.3	0	what
0.6	0.6	they're

0.9	1	
0.2	0.2	ZUCKERBERG:
0.1	0.6	Congressman,
0.4	0.8	thanks.
0.5	0	We
0.5	0.6	are
0.7	0	very
0.8	0.2	focused
0.3	1	on
0.2	0.8	fighting
0.7	0.1	against
0.1	0.9	election
0.6	0.3	interference
0.8	0.4	and
0.9	0.8	were
0.4	0.1	also
0.7	0.9	very
0.2	1	focused
0.3	0.3	on
1	0.6	fighting
0.2	0.8	against
0.1	0.1	hate
0.3	0.5	speech.
0.9	1	And
0.6	0	our
0.3	0.4	commitments
0.7	0.7	to
0	0.1	those
0.4	0.5	issues
0.5	0.1	inviting
0.8	0.9	them
0.7	0.7	go
0.5	0.5	back
0.3	0.5	years
0.1	0.6	before
0.5	1	this
0.5	0.7	recent
0.8	0.1	movement.
0.2	0.2	Since
0.1	0.5	2016,
0.3	0.7	the
0.1	0	defenses
0.6	0.7	is
1	0.4	that
0.1	0.5	the
0.4	0.4	company
0.6	0.3	has
0.2	0.2	built
0.3	0.8	up
0.4	1	to
0.8	0.9	help
0.2	0.8	secure
0.2	0.6	elections
0.9	0.3	not
1	0.9	just
0.7	0.7	in
0.5	0.6	the
0.8	1	U.S.
0.7	0.7	around
0.1	0.3	the
0.6	0.5	world
0.7	0.1	I
1	0.5	think
0.7	0.7	are
0	0.7	some
0.9	0.5	of
0.7	0.8	the
0.7	0.7	most
0.3	0.3	advanced
0.6	0.7	that
0.4	0.8	any
0.9	0.1	company
0.9	0.3	or
0.7	0.8	government
0	0.2	has
1	0.5	in
0.4	0.4	the
0.1	0.8	world
0.4	0.6	now.
0.3	0.7	We
0.1	0.3	routinely
0	0.3	now
0.9	1	collaborate
0	0.2	with
0.1	0.9	law
0.1	0.4	enforcement
0.5	1	and
0	0.6	intelligence
0.5	1	agencies
0.2	0.3	and--and
0.9	0.3	are
0.6	0.1	able
0.1	0.1	to
0.7	0.5	sometimes
0.4	0.8	identify
0.2	0.4	threats
0.1	1	coming
0.1	0.3	from
0.6	0.2	other
0.6	0.4	countries
0.8	0.1	before
0.9	0.3	governments
0.3	0	are
0.8	0.7	even
0.3	0.8	able
0.9	0.5	to.
0.3	0.3	In
0	0.4	terms
0.1	0.1	of
0.5	0.7	fighting
0.3	1	hate,
0.3	0.1	we've
0.8	0.9	built
0.7	0	really
0.3	0.9	sophisticated
0.6	0.9	systems.
0.3	0.8	Our
0.1	0.6	goal
0.9	0.7	is
0.3	0.3	to
0.2	0.4	identify
0.8	0.9	it
0.7	0.6	before
0.4	0.2	anyone
0.3	0.1	even
0.3	0.2	sees
0.5	0.8	it
0.7	0.7	on
0.1	0.7	the
0	0.8	platform
0.4	0.7	and
0.5	0.2	we've
0.9	0.7	built
0.5	0.7	AI
0.8	0.4	systems
0.6	0.8	and,
0.7	0.6	as
0.9	0.9	I
0.8	0.5	mentioned,
0.1	0.3	have
0.1	1	tens
0	0.7	of
0.2	0.7	thousands
0.7	0.7	of
0.9	0.6	people
0.7	0.8	working
0.1	0.1	on
0.6	0.6	safety
0.1	0.5	and
0.1	0.9	security
0.3	0.8	with
0.8	0.3	the
0.7	0.2	goal
0.8	0.6	of
0.2	0.8	getting
0.7	0.5	this
0.4	0	stuff
0.8	0.1	down
0.7	0.9	so
0.8	0.9	that
0.8	0.5	way--before
0.8	0.2	people
0.1	0.6	even
0.5	0.9	see
0.4	0.1	it.
0	0.6	And
0.3	0.9	right
0	1	now
0.4	0.8	we're
0.1	0	able
0.7	0.8	to
0.8	0.3	proactively
0.1	0.6	identify
0.8	0.2	89
0.4	0.7	percent
0.3	0.1	of
0.9	0	the
0.6	0.2	hate
0.7	0.8	speech
0.3	0.2	that
0	0.8	we
0.6	0	take
0.5	0.9	down
0.4	0.9	before
0.1	1	I
0.6	0.4	think
0.5	0.1	it's
0.1	0.6	even--even
1	0.9	seen
0.5	0	by
0.4	0.2	other
0.5	0.2	people.
0.4	0.1	So--you
0.8	0.2	know--I--I
0.2	0.8	want
0.2	0.2	to
0.1	0.1	do
0.6	1	better
0.9	0.8	than
0.8	0.5	89
0.1	0.8	percent.
0	0.9	I'd
0.9	0.2	like
0.5	0.3	to
0.7	0.7	get
0.6	0.8	that
0.1	0.9	to--to
0.4	0.8	99
0.5	0.7	percent.
0.5	0	But
0.2	0.2	we
0.8	1	have
1	0.4	a--a
0.7	0.8	massive
0.2	0.6	investment
0.6	0.6	here.
0.7	0.1	We
0.3	0.6	invest
0.6	0.9	in
0.4	0.5	billions
0.9	0.6	of
0.5	0.6	dollars--
0.6	0.7	
0.6	0.2	
0.6	0.2	RASKIN:
0.7	0.1	--Can--can

0.5	0.4	just

0.8	0.5	me--because
0.3	0.1	my
0	0.8	time's
0.3	0.7	almost
0.5	0.3	out.
0.2	0.9	I--can--can
0.1	0.5	you
0.4	0.8	just
0.6	0.2	address
0.4	0.1	the
0.1	0.5	proliferation
0.9	0.3	of
0.8	0.1	fake
0.8	0	accounts?
0.7	0.5	I
0	0.9	understand

1	0.8	fake

0.2	0.6	But
0.8	0.1	in
0	0.4	some

0.9	0.7	you
0.7	0.3	have
0.9	1	a

0.9	0.3	that's
0.5	0.4	linked
0	0.8	to

0.7	0.4	that's

0.5	0.2	ZUCKERBERG:

0.6	0.2	absolutely.
0.1	0.3	We
0.8	0.9	work
1	0.8	hard
0.4	0.1	on
0.7	0	this.
0.9	0.8	We

1	0.3	of

0.5	0	A

0.9	0.8	I
0.9	0.8	now
0.7	0.1	recognize
0.7	0.4	the

0.2	0.2	from
0.2	0.6	North
0.7	0.1	Dakota,
0.6	1	Mr.

0.8	0.4	for
0.4	0.6	five
0.7	0.7	minutes.
0	0.9	
0.9	0.9	
0.9	0.3	ARMSTRONG:
0.2	1	Google
0	0.7	has
0.4	0.9	received
0	0.9	criticism
0.7	0.6	about--about
0.4	0.8	bias
0.8	0.8	against
0.2	1	conservatives
0.5	0.1	and
0.3	0.7	content
0.5	0.7	moderation.
0.8	0.6	There
0.6	0.2	were
0.3	0.9	threats
0.2	0.7	of
0.7	0.2	monetizing
0.1	0.5	the
0.8	0.3	Federalist
0.9	0.5	and
0.8	0.3	numerous
0.6	1	other
0.6	0.6	complaints
1	0.5	of
0.9	0.9	viewpoints
0.2	0.4	oppression.
0.1	0.1	As
0.4	1	a
1	0.2	result,
0.1	0.8	a
0.5	0.5	significant
0.8	0.1	portion
0.9	0.5	of
0.8	0.2	the
0.6	0.3	American
0.9	0.1	public
0.2	0.4	has
0.3	0.8	lost
0.1	0.4	trust
0.4	0.5	in
0.6	0.6	your
0.1	0	company.
0.3	0.4	A
0.7	0.1	lack
0.3	0.1	of
0.9	0.4	public
0.7	0.9	confidence
0.3	0.3	in
0.3	0.2	a
0.2	0.7	product
1	0.6	usually
0.7	0.8	means
0.5	0.7	there
0.6	0.4	is
0.3	0.7	economic
0.1	0.9	harm
0.2	0.2	to
0.8	0.9	the
1	0.7	company.
0.1	0.7	But
0.8	0.9	that
0.1	0.5	just
0.3	0.3	isn't
0.3	0.9	the
0.7	0.3	case
0.6	0.6	with
0.9	0.4	Google.
0.2	0.2	So
0.6	0.2	I
0	0.6	think
0.4	0.6	it's
0.5	0.2	a
0.9	0.6	legitimate
0.7	0.2	question
0.4	0	as
0.6	0.2	to
0.4	0.3	whether
0.9	0.8	Google's
0.2	0.6	market
0.2	0.8	power
0.2	0.1	insulates
1	0.9	it
1	0.1	from
0.6	0.1	loss
0.7	0.5	of
0.2	0.6	revenue
0.4	0.1	normally
0	0.2	associated
0.3	0.9	with
0.6	0.6	offending
0.1	1	half
1	0.7	the
0.5	0.7	people
0.8	0.6	who
0.6	0.6	use
0	1	your
0.6	0.7	product.
0.1	0.1	I
0.7	0.2	also
0.7	0.9	think
0.1	0.6	it's
0.5	0.9	a
0.4	0.3	legitimate
0.7	0.3	question
0.3	0.9	to
0.7	0.9	ask
0.3	0.7	if
0.6	0.5	other
0.7	0.1	attempts
0.9	0.9	to
0.1	0.5	regulate
1	0.4	your
0.6	0.5	industries
0.9	0.6	have
0.1	0.7	worked.
0	0.8	So,
0.2	1	Mr.
0.5	0.7	Pichai,
0.8	0.8	Google
0	0.2	has
0.1	0.6	restricted
0.7	0.1	advertising
0.1	0.3	analytics
0.8	0.5	or
0.3	0.8	the
0.9	0.6	portability
0.9	0.5	of
0.2	0.5	user
1	0.7	data
0.3	0.4	related
0.5	0.3	to
0.6	0.4	advertising
0.6	0.8	due
0.3	0.1	to
0.8	1	compliance
0.3	0.1	with
0.1	0.9	the
0.2	0.6	general
0.6	0.3	data
0.1	0.5	protection
0.3	0.6	regulation.
0.9	0.9	Specifically
0.6	0.5	in
0.6	0	2018,
0.5	0.7	Google
0.6	0.9	restricted
1	0.3	the
1	0.6	ability
0.6	0.1	to
1	0.7	export
0.6	0.7	the
0.4	0.3	double
0.1	0.9	ID,
0.8	0.9	a
0.6	0.7	cookie-based
0.1	0	identifier
0.6	0.9	that
0.2	0.4	complies
0.9	0.3	individual
0.4	0.5	user
0.7	0.3	data
0.5	0.9	and
0.4	0.3	creates
1	0.9	profiles
0.1	0.4	through
1	0.7	Google
0.2	0.4	data
1	0.2	transfer.
0	0.3	Is
1	0.3	that
0.6	0.3	correct?
0.1	0.5	
0.7	1	
0.4	0.7	PICHAI:
0.1	0.1	Congressman,
0.4	0.8	I'm
0.3	0.9	not
0.5	0.8	familiar
0	0.2	with
0.5	0.9	the
0.6	0.4	specifics
0.6	0.7	of
0.9	0.9	that
0.3	0.3	particular
0.9	0.4	issue,
0.8	0.3	but
0.7	0.9	happy
0.8	0.9	to
0.3	0.2	follow-up
0.4	0.1	more
0.9	0.9	once
0.3	0.9	I
0.5	0	understand
0.6	0.9	it
0.1	0.4	better.
0	0	
0.5	0.4	
0.6	0.3	ARMSTRONG:
0.3	0.3	So
0.8	0.7	you're
0.3	0.6	not
0.2	0.9	particular--particularly
0.8	0.1	familiar
0.3	0.9	with
0.2	1	how
0.8	0.8	you're
0.3	0.5	complying
0.5	0.8	with
0.8	0.8	GDPR.
0.4	0.3	
0.3	0.9	
0.7	0.1	PICHAI:
0.4	0.6	Congressman,
0.3	0.7	we--we've
0.9	0.3	long
0.3	0.2	been
0.9	0.1	working
0	1	to
0.8	0.8	comply
0.2	0.7	with
0.4	0.3	GDPR.
0.2	0.6	We
0.4	0.9	think
0.8	1	it's
0.2	0.3	an
1	0.1	important
0.6	0.4	regulation.
0.8	0.5	And,
0.7	0.3	you
0.3	0.6	know,
0.7	0	we
1	0.1	have--you
1	0.4	know,
0.4	0.2	we
0.7	0.1	are
0.8	0.5	in
0.1	0.9	full
0.3	0.6	compliance
0.3	0.3	to
0.8	0.8	the
0.7	0.3	extent
0.1	0.6	of
0	0.9	my
0.9	0.6	knowledge.
0.8	0.1	I
0.7	0.9	just
0.1	0.6	meant
0.5	0.3	I'm
0.6	0.5	not
0.8	0.9	aware
0.6	1	of
0.9	0.6	that
0	1	specific
0.3	0.7	issue
0.5	0.3	with
0.1	0.2	identifier
0.3	0.7	you
0.2	0.8	mentioned
0.3	0.4	there.
0.8	0.2	But
0.7	0.3	I'm
0.6	0.4	happy
0.6	0.1	to
0.1	0.5	understand
0.3	1	it
0.3	0.6	better
0	0.8	and
0.8	0.8	follow-up.
0.2	0.4	
0.4	0.7	
0.9	0.7	ARMSTRONG:
0.5	0	All
0	0.4	right.
0.1	0.1	So
0.1	0.2	in
0.8	0.2	order
0.1	0.9	to
0.2	0.4	comply
0.8	0.4	with
0.4	1	GDPR,
0.5	0.7	Google
0.8	0.4	must
0.5	0.1	retain
0.8	0.7	control
0.4	0.1	over
0.3	0.5	more
0.3	0.2	user
0.3	0.1	data
0.8	0.8	and
0.9	0.2	restrict
0.6	0.2	the
0.6	0.8	ability
0.7	0.6	to
0.8	0.5	combine
0.2	0.7	this
0.8	0.7	user
0.6	0.8	data
0.3	1	with
0.7	0.3	other
0.1	0.5	platforms
1	0.5	to
0.7	0.5	conduct--cross
0.8	0.3	platform
0.2	0.1	analysis.
0.4	0.3	It
0.1	0.6	seems
0.3	0.1	as
0.4	0.2	if
0.4	0.7	that
0.4	0.4	ultimately
0.5	0.3	limits
0.9	0.4	the
0.2	0.3	ability
0.1	0.4	of
0.1	0.8	advertisers
0.2	0	to
0.1	0.3	make
0.1	0.6	comparisons
0.5	0.1	between--Google
0.3	0.9	based
0.8	0.8	campaigns
0.1	0.1	and
0.3	0.9	non-Google
0.2	1	based
0.7	0.7	campaigns.
0.3	0.5	Would
0.1	0.5	you
0.8	0.5	agree
0	0.5	with
0.3	0.8	that?
0.6	0.1	
0.6	0.5	
0.9	0.1	PICHAI:
0	0.4	In
0.2	0.9	all
0.6	0.2	of
0.7	0.1	these
0.9	0.1	ecosystems,
0.4	0.8	we
0	0.8	are--we
0.3	0.7	are
0.3	0.3	balancing
0.7	0.7	between
0.4	0.1	users,
0.3	0.2	advertisers
0.6	1	and
0.3	1	publishers.
0.9	0.4	We
0.4	0.9	deeply
0.5	0.8	care
0.6	0.8	about
0.5	0.1	the
0.9	0.4	privacy
0.3	0.7	and
0.8	0.3	security
0.4	0.1	of
1	0.3	our
0.3	0.7	users,
0.8	0.4	and
0.7	0.7	so
0.3	0.4	when
0.8	0.7	we
0.1	0.7	serve
0.9	0.3	these
1	1	ecosystems,
0.9	0.8	we
0.3	0.3	have
0.8	1	to
0.2	0.2	take
0.1	0.9	that
0.9	0.5	into
0.3	0.1	account.
0	0.6	We
0.7	0.9	have
0.8	0	to
0.6	0.7	comply
0.5	0.9	with
0.6	0.9	important
0.8	0	laws
0.9	0.6	and
0.3	0.9	regulations
1	0.7	in
0.3	0.3	every
0.1	0.9	country
0.8	0.8	we
0.7	0.9	operate
0.1	0.3	it.
1	0.3	And
0.7	0.2	so
0.6	0.3	that--that's
0.6	0.4	the
0.7	0.2	delicate
0.6	0.8	balance
0.9	0.7	we
1	0.2	are
0	0.4	constantly
0	0.2	striking,
0.9	0.7	but
0	0.3	we
0.6	0.6	are
0.3	0.2	focused
0.6	0.8	on
0.4	0.9	our
0.9	0.1	users
1	0.7	and
0.2	0.8	trying
0.4	0.2	to
0.3	0.5	do
0.1	0.7	the
0.5	0.7	best
0.4	0.7	we
0.5	0.7	can.
0.6	0.1	
0.5	0.9	
0.7	0.3	ARMSTRONG:
0.1	0.2	And
0.2	0.4	I--I
0.9	0.7	just
0.1	0.7	want
0.4	0.8	to
0.4	0.6	be
0.6	0.1	perfectly
0.2	0.3	clear.
0.2	0.9	I--I
0.2	0.3	personally
0.9	0.3	believe
0.1	0.9	that--that
0.3	0.2	just
1	0.5	the
0.9	0.2	market
0.1	0.9	power
0.1	0.7	consolidation
0.9	0.6	is
0.1	1	significant.
0.9	0.8	But
0.3	0.1	I
0.7	0.5	also
0.1	0.1	want
0.6	0	to
0.2	0.1	be
0.2	0.4	clear
0.3	0.7	that
0.8	0.1	when
0.8	0.9	we're
0.2	0.3	moving
0.4	0.9	forward
0.8	0.1	to
0.8	0.6	regulate
0.9	0.6	this,
0.5	0.5	that
0.5	0.3	we
1	0.1	aren't
0.6	0.8	actually
0.6	0.1	squeezing
0.3	0.1	out
0.6	0.2	competition
0.8	0.3	in
1	0.1	our
0.4	0.9	quest--in
0.8	0	our--in
0	0.3	our
0	0.7	quest
0.1	0.4	to
0	0.3	do
0.9	0.8	something.
0.8	0.5	Because
0.8	0.2	I've
0.6	0.4	said
0.8	0.2	that.
0.2	0.9	I've
0.6	0.5	said
0.3	0.1	that
0.2	0.5	before
0.3	0.6	in
0.8	0.4	this
0.3	0.9	hearing,
0.2	0.1	and
0.5	0	I'll
0.2	0.7	say
0.9	0.5	it
0.4	0.8	again.
0.4	0.3	Usually
0.8	0.8	in
0.9	0.3	our
0.5	0.1	quest
0.9	1	to--to
0.9	0	regulate
0.4	0.8	big
1	0.6	companies,
0.8	0.2	we
0.8	0.1	end
0.6	0.7	up
0.4	0.6	hurting
1	0.6	small
0.5	0.7	companies
0.7	0.8	more.
0.7	0.2	And
0.4	0.8	I'm
0.5	0.9	a
0.8	0.3	strong
0.8	0.4	privacy
0.1	0.3	advocate,
0.9	0.1	but
0.7	0.4	the
0.6	0.2	consequences
0.4	0.9	of
0.9	0.7	GDPR
0.1	0	have
0.9	0.3	been
0.9	0.8	to
0.9	0.6	further
0.8	0.1	entrench
0.5	0.1	large
0.9	0.1	established
0.9	0.7	actors
0.7	0.2	like
0.1	0.3	Google,
0.6	0.9	leading
0.2	0	to
0.8	0.1	regulatory
0.5	1	capture
0.9	0.3	that
0.5	0.7	exasperates
0.8	0.9	competition
0.4	0.2	concerns.
0.6	0.5	And
0.8	0.4	Google's
0.3	0.2	digital
0	0.6	ad
1	0.7	market
0.2	0.6	share
0.6	0.1	has
0.3	0.4	increased
0.7	0.6	since
0.5	0.8	the
0.8	0.4	implication--implementation
0.3	0.5	of
0.6	0.1	GDPR.
0.2	0.6	Do
0	0.8	you
0.1	0.8	know
0.5	0.3	that
0	0.4	to
0.6	0.8	be
0.3	0.2	correct?
0.4	0.8	
0.1	0.3	
0.5	0.3	PICHAI:
0.5	0.2	Congressman,
0.4	0.9	to
0.5	0.9	just
0.4	0	give
0.6	0.5	you
0.3	0.2	a
0.1	0.6	sense
0.2	0.3	of
0.8	0.7	the
0.9	0	robust
0.4	0.3	competition
0.6	0.1	we
0.8	0.9	see,
0.3	0	ad
0.6	0.9	prices
1	0.5	have
0.9	0.3	fallen
0	0.7	down
0.8	0	by
0.3	0.1	40
0.3	0.3	percent
0.6	0.8	in
0.3	0.7	the
0.7	0.4	past
0.7	0.3	ten
0.3	0.6	years.
0.3	0.9	And
0.2	0.7	in
0.8	0.9	fact,
1	0.6	in
0.4	0.6	the
0.1	0.1	U.S.,
0.4	0.9	advertising
0.8	0.8	as
0	0.5	a
0.1	0.1	share
0.3	0.9	of
0.6	0	GDP
0.8	0.5	has
0.7	0.7	come
0.8	0.7	down
0.7	0.8	from
0.2	0.7	1.4
0.1	0.3	percent
1	0.4	in
0.8	1	1990
0.8	0.6	to
0.9	0.7	less
0.3	0.6	than
0.4	0.4	1
0.7	0.7	percent
0.9	0.8	today.
0.3	0.5	So
0.9	1	we
0.7	0.6	see
0.5	0.3	robust
0.7	0.6	competition
0.8	0.9	in
0.1	0.3	the
1	0.7	marketplace.
0.3	0.2	And
0.3	0.9	as
0.2	0.6	I
0.3	0	said
1	0.2	earlier,
0.4	0.1	you
0.3	0.2	know,
0.3	0.6	we
0.7	0.4	have
0.1	0.8	to
0.4	0	comply
0.4	0.8	with
0.1	0.7	regulation.
0.6	0.3	We
0.5	0.7	have
0.9	0.7	to
0.6	0.4	interpret
0.1	0.1	it
1	0.2	strictly.
0.4	0.8	And
0.3	1	we
0.8	0.7	have
0.2	0.2	to
0.7	0.9	balance
0.1	0.5	the
0	0.6	ecosystem.
0.6	0.3	But
0	0.7	our
0.6	0.9	utmost
0.3	0.1	care
0.3	0	is
0.1	0.3	ensuring
0.9	0.1	privacy
0.9	0.1	and
0.6	0.5	security
0.3	0.1	of
0.3	0.6	our

0.9	0.2	as
0.6	0.3	we
0.2	0.9	serve
0.1	0.2	these

0.2	0.2	
0.8	0.1	
0.2	0.6	ARMSTRONG:
0.4	0.5	And
0.6	0.9	I'm
0.4	0.9	glad
0.1	0.2	you
0.1	0.2	mentioned
0.5	0.6	privacy
0.5	0.6	because
0.3	0.6	I
0.7	0.6	would
0.9	0.9	be
0.8	0.2	remiss
0.8	0.7	if
0.3	0.1	I
0.5	0.6	didn't
0.9	0.2	deal
0.4	0.5	with
0.1	0	this
0.1	0.2	issue
0.5	0.4	because
0.8	0.5	it
0	0.3	is
0.6	0.4	so
0.3	0.7	relevant.
0.9	0.1	And
0.1	0.6	I
0.8	0.6	think
0.9	0.1	generally
0.6	0.3	speaking,
0.4	1	outside
0.3	0.7	of
0.4	0.5	the
0.4	0.1	political
0.1	0.9	issues
0	0	and
0.9	0.8	the

0.8	0.6	with
0.4	1	all
0.4	1	of
0.2	0	this,
0.3	0.2	and
0.6	0.4	this
0.5	0.5	is
0.8	0.3	for
0.5	0.2	essentially
0.7	0.4	all
0.3	0.7	four
0.7	0.7	of
0.3	0.7	our
0.4	0.9	witnesses,
0.1	0.8	I
0.3	0.8	think
0.8	0.3	one
0.7	0.6	of
0.2	0	our
0.8	0.8	bigger
0.4	0.8	concerns
0.6	0.9	when
0.1	0.7	we
0.3	0.8	talk
0.9	0.8	about
0.3	0.6	data
0.2	0.4	and
0.3	0.7	value--and
0.8	0.1	that
0.5	0.3	data
0.9	0.5	having
0.5	0.6	value
0.9	0.4	and
1	0.7	privacy,
0.5	0.3	that--which
0.9	0.3	is
0.9	0.8	where
0.9	1	people
0.3	0.5	really
0.6	0.9	get
0.5	1	concerned
0	0.5	with
1	0.6	how
0.8	0.8	the
0.9	0.6	digital
0.5	0.5	age
0.3	0.8	is--moving
0.2	0.3	forward.
1	0.8	And
0	0.7	there
0.7	0.2	are
0.5	0	news
0.8	0.4	reports
0.8	0.8	that
0.5	0.2	law
0.3	0.5	enforcement
0.1	0.3	has

0.8	0.3	increasing
0.7	0.8	use
0.4	0.6	of
0.2	0.4	what
0.8	0.1	are
0.5	0	called
0.5	0.5	GEO-fence
0.8	0.3	warrants.
0.3	0.6	And
0.8	0.7	these
0.7	0.6	GEO-fence
0.9	0.9	warrants
0.3	0.7	allow
0	0.5	authorities
0.4	0.8	to
0.1	0.7	compel
0.5	0.2	technology
0.5	0.2	companies
1	0.6	to

0.8	0.3	And
0.9	0	that's
0.3	0.6	not
0.7	0.7	what
0.6	0.7	these

0.1	0	These

0.1	0.7	for
0.8	0.2	any

0.8	0.5	So
0.1	0.5	unless

0.9	0.6	I
0.7	0.2	believe
0.5	0.7	that
0.3	0.4	the

0.4	0.8	information
0.8	0.2	should
0.1	0.2	be

0.7	0.5	Do
0.3	0.3	you
0.8	0.7	agree?
0.3	1	
0.2	0.8	
0.1	0.6	PICHAI:
0.5	0.6	You
0.1	1	know,
0.7	0.8	I'm
0.1	0.9	happy
0.3	0.6	to
0.2	0.8	understand
0.8	0.6	more.
0.6	0.1	We
0.6	0.6	deeply
0.2	0.9	care
0.7	0.8	about
0.5	0.9	it.
0.4	0.1	This
0.6	0.6	is
0.1	0	why
1	0.5	we
0.9	0.4	shoot
0.1	0.1	transparency
0.8	0.3	(INAUDIBLE)
0.1	0.6	because
0.9	0.2	we
0.8	0.6	think
0.7	0.1	it's
0.1	0.4	an
0.9	0.2	important
0.1	0.5	area
0.5	0.8	for
0.4	0.3	Congress
0.3	0.3	to
0.9	0.4	have
0.5	0.3	oversight.
0.4	0.8	And
1	0.5	we
0.3	0.8	recently
0.8	0	made
0.1	0.7	a
1	0.4	change
0.4	0.2	by
0.5	0.3	which
0.2	0.9	we
0	0.2	automatically
1	0.7	delete
0.7	1	location
0.9	0.7	activity
0.7	0.4	after
0.9	0.2	a
0.8	0.9	certain
0.2	0.1	period
0.5	0.7	of
0.1	0.8	time
0.7	0.3	by
0.1	0.6	default
0.7	0.8	for
0.1	0.5	our
0.3	0.7	users.
0.1	0.5	So
0.3	0.5	we
0.9	0.8	are
0.7	0.5	happy
0.7	0.3	to
1	0.3	engage
0.3	0.5	with
0.4	0.8	the
0.3	0.3	office,
0	0.8	congressman,
0.9	0.7	and--and--and
0.9	0.2	engage
0.8	0.1	more.
0.9	0	
0.1	0.2	
1	0.9	ARMSTRONG:
0.2	0.8	And
0.1	0.4	I'm
0.9	0.5	using
1	0.6	you
0.5	0.7	because
0.2	0.7	these
0.3	0.1	are
0.6	0.3	going
0.3	0.3	on
0.3	0.6	in
0.6	0.8	Virginia
0.4	0.3	and
0.3	0.3	New
0.3	0.7	York,
0.5	0.2	I
0.9	0.3	think,
0.4	0.8	right
0.5	0.1	now.
0.9	0	But
0.2	0.8	I
0.9	0.7	mean,
0.6	0.9	this--this
0	0.2	equates
0.4	0.5	for
0.3	0.3	everything.
1	1	I
0.8	0.6	think
0.8	0.9	people
0	0.2	would
0.9	0.6	be
0.8	0.7	terrified
0.6	0.8	to
0.3	0.3	know
0.6	0.3	that
0.3	0.6	law
0.6	0.9	enforcement
0.4	0.2	could
0.1	0.5	grab
0.5	1	general
0.2	0.7	warrants
0.8	0.4	and
0.5	0.7	get
0.7	0.5	everybody's
0.4	0.9	information
0.8	0.5	anywhere.
0.3	0.5	So
0.1	0.6	it
0.9	0.9	requires
0.5	0.4	Congress
0.6	0.2	to
0.6	0.8	act
0.7	0.6	and
0.7	0.3	it
0.7	0.4	requires
0.8	0.9	everybody
0.7	0.6	that
0.6	0.4	is
0.4	0.2	a
0.9	0.2	witness
0.8	0.6	in
0.7	0.6	this
0.9	0.6	hearing
0.2	0	to
0.8	0.4	be
0.4	0.6	willing
0.6	0.1	to
0.8	0.7	work,
0.6	0.1	too,
0.5	0.7	because
0.6	0.9	it
0.4	0.2	is
0.7	0.7	the
0.9	0.6	single
0.5	0.1	most
0.8	0.5	important
0.1	0.3	issue.
0.8	0.3	I
0.6	0.8	think
0.8	1	we're--.
1	0.8	
0.5	0.8	
0.9	0.6	CICILLINE:
0.7	0.8	The
1	0.4	time

0.8	0	but
0.8	0.8	I
0.3	0.1	believe
0.8	0.6	he

0.7	0.8	consent

0.6	0.8	
0.5	0.1	ARMSTRONG:
0.3	0.3	I

0.6	0.8	I'm
0.5	0.9	not

0.6	0.7	as

0.1	0.6	what
0.4	0.1	I
0	1	can
0.7	0.7	tell
0.5	0.1	you.
0.7	0.7	We

0.6	0.8	certain

0.7	0.6	in

0.5	0.3	We
1	0.5	train
0.1	0.4	people
0.3	0.3	on
0.9	0.7	the

0.3	0.3	And
0.7	0.1	we
0.2	0.1	expect
0.4	0.1	people
0.5	0.4	to
0.4	0.8	follow
0.3	0.2	that
0.5	0.5	policy
1	0.7	the
0.3	0.2	same
0.1	0.8	way
0.1	0.4	we
0.7	0.9	would
0.3	0.8	any
0.8	0.8	other.
0.3	0.4	It's
0.3	0	a
0.8	0.3	voluntary
0.9	0.6	policy.
0.4	0.5	As
0.3	0.4	far
0.2	0.6	as
0.4	0.6	I'm
0.2	0.4	aware,
0.7	0.1	no

0.7	0.3	retailer--.
0.3	0.4	
0.7	0.2	
0.3	0.4	JAYAPAL:
0.7	0.7	So
0.9	0.2	there's
0.4	0.1	no--so
0.1	0.4	there's
0.1	0.9	no
0.5	0.4	actual--.
0.6	0.3	
0.4	0.9	
0.3	0.8	BEZOS:

0.3	0.5	
0.8	0.5	
0.2	0.3	JAYAPAL:
0.5	0.7	There's

0.2	0.1	There's

0.5	0.2	enforcement
0.8	0.9	of
0.5	0.6	that

0.1	0.9	So
0.4	0.1	it's
0.3	0.6	voluntary,
0.4	0.9	and
0.7	0.2	there's
0.8	0.4	no

0.8	0.3	So
0.8	0.9	maybe
0.9	0.5	that

0.7	0.9	BEZOS:

0.3	0.9	I'm
0.8	0.4	trying

0.3	0.2	that
0.7	0.6	Amazon's--the
0.9	0.9	fact
0	0.3	that
0.3	0.1	we
0.5	0.2	have
1	0.4	such
0.9	0.1	a
0.8	0.4	policy
0.8	0.6	is
0.2	1	voluntary.
0.8	0.8	I
0.1	0	think
0.9	0.1	no
0.7	0.8	other
0.9	0.8	retailer
0.1	0.5	even
0	0.2	has
0.8	0.9	such

0.2	0.1	
0.2	1	
0.6	0.5	JAYAPAL:
0.2	0.1	Well,
0.9	0.8	that's--that's--.
0.9	0.3	
0.2	0.8	
0.2	0.9	BEZOS:
0.2	0.1	Our
0.2	1	enforcement
0.9	0.5	of
0.4	0.8	that
0	0.8	policy,
0.1	0.1	we--we
0.5	0.4	would
0	0	treat
0.1	0.1	that
0.4	0.8	like
0.7	0.6	any
1	0.8	internal
0	0.3	policy.
0.9	0.9	And
0.7	0.5	if
0.7	0.2	we
0.5	0.2	found
0.8	0.1	that
0.1	0.2	someone
0.2	0.9	violated
0.3	0.4	it,
0.7	0.6	we
0.3	0.7	would
0.8	0.3	take
0.7	0	action
0.9	0.3	against
0.8	0.5	them.
0.1	0.1	
0.6	0.3	
0.7	0.6	JAYAPAL:
0.7	0.1	Well,
0	0.5	there's
0.7	0.9	numerous
1	0.4	reports
0.2	0.8	and
0.8	0.3	the
0.8	0.9	committee
0.8	0.4	has
1	0.3	conducted
0.7	0.8	interviews
0.4	0.5	with
0.6	0.5	former
0.1	0.3	employees
0.8	0.5	who
0.1	0.6	confirm
0.6	0.9	that
0.1	0.5	there
0.8	0.9	are
1	0.5	employees
0.5	0.7	who
0.5	0.8	do
0.2	0.9	have
0	0.8	access
0.7	1	to
1	0	that
0.4	0.7	data
0	0.3	and
0.8	0.9	are
0.1	0.3	using
0.5	0.5	it.
0.8	0.3	And
0.4	1	so
0.8	0.9	my
0.2	0.8	next
0.5	0.3	question
0.5	0.1	was
0.7	1	going
0.3	0	to
0.4	0.2	be
0.2	0.8	if
0.1	0.2	you--if
0.8	0.9	you
0.2	1	thought
0.6	0.7	you
0.6	0.1	were
0.3	0.1	actually
0	0.1	enforcing
0.9	0.3	these
1	0.4	rules,
0.9	0.3	do
0.5	0.8	you
0.4	0.8	think
0.5	0.5	that
0.1	0.4	that's
0.7	0.4	working?
0.3	1	And
0.9	0.2	again,
0.1	0.2	I
0.6	0.3	would
0.4	0.7	just
0.4	0.3	say
0.7	0.7	that
0.2	0.2	there's
0.8	0.2	credible
0	0.1	reporting
0.1	0.5	that's
0.3	0.8	documented
0.7	0.3	of
0.6	0.6	these
0.4	0.3	rules
0.4	0.6	that
0.7	0.8	you
0.2	0.7	have
0.5	0.3	put
0.3	0.7	into
0.3	0.9	place.
0.4	0.8	And
0.1	1	the
0.6	0.3	committee
0.8	0.8	has
0.2	0.7	interviewed
0.1	0.6	employees
0.9	1	that
0.6	0.8	typically
0.2	0.3	say--say
0.8	0.5	that
0	0.3	these
0.8	0.3	breaches
0.8	0.5	typically
0.7	0.8	occur.
0.9	0.4	Let's
0.1	0.4	talk
0.6	0.7	about
0.5	0.4	aggregate
0.9	0.1	data
0.7	0.1	for
0.1	0.5	a
0.9	0.9	minute.
0.7	0.8	Your
0.1	0	rules
0.7	0.5	do
0.6	0.3	allow
0.5	0.5	for
0.8	0.8	you
1	0.2	to
0.3	0.1	access
0.5	0.6	combined
0.8	0.2	data
0.6	0.2	on
0.8	0.8	a
0.8	0.7	product
0.8	0.4	when
0.3	0.9	there
0.2	1	are
0.5	0.1	only
0.2	0.3	one
0.1	0.5	or
0.3	0.1	two
0.1	0.1	sellers
0.5	0.8	in
0.5	0.2	the
0.3	0.2	marketplace,
0.2	0.2	correct?
0.7	0.7	
0.8	0.5	
0.6	0.7	BEZOS:
0.5	1	Yes.
1	0.3	Aggregate
0.6	1	data
0.8	0.1	is
0.1	0.7	allowed
0.7	0.4	under
0	0.1	our
0.8	1	policies.
0.6	0.8	That
0.7	0.2	is
0.7	0.4	correct.
0.5	0.8	
0.8	0.5	
0.5	0.3	JAYAPAL:
0.4	0.8	And
0.2	0.8	interviews
0.2	0.7	with
0.1	0.7	former
0.5	0.3	employees
0.5	0.1	have
0.3	0.8	made
1	0.8	it
0.9	0.9	clear
0.5	0.7	that
0.8	0.5	that
0.8	0.3	aggregate
1	0.6	data
0.6	0.4	essentially
0.9	0.1	allows
0.4	0.3	access
0.5	0.8	to
0.8	1	highly
0.2	0.6	detailed
0.5	0.3	data
0.7	0.1	in
0.6	0.3	those
0	0.4	product
0.1	0.7	categories.
0.6	0.8	There's
0	0.6	the
0.7	0	example
1	0.7	of
0.3	0.1	Fortem,
0.7	0.8	a
0.4	0.2	small
0.8	0.6	business
0.1	0.1	that
0.7	0.9	had
0.1	0.8	no
0.2	0.1	direct
0	0.4	competitors
0.7	0.6	except
0.9	0.2	for
0.2	0.2	Amazon
0.8	0.4	warehouse
0.6	0.4	deals,
0.6	0.3	a
0.2	0	resale
0.3	0.5	clearing
0.5	0.9	account--clearance
0.5	0.4	account
0.7	0.6	that
0.7	0.7	only
0.7	0.9	sold
0.1	0.1	17
0.6	0.1	units.
0.9	0.3	An
0.1	0.1	Amazon
0.6	0.3	employees
0.4	1	accessed
0.8	0.6	a
0.6	0	detailed
0.8	0.9	sales
0.1	0.9	report
0.7	0.4	on
0.7	0.4	Fortem's
0.4	0.3	product
0.8	0.3	with
0.4	0.3	information
0.4	0	on
0.8	0.3	how
0.5	0.8	much
0.8	0.1	the
0.8	0.5	company
0.5	0.2	spent
0.1	0.6	on
1	0.6	advertising
0.6	0.9	per
0.4	0	unit
0.3	0.8	and
0.1	0.6	the
0.6	0.7	cost
0.8	0.6	to
0.1	0.2	ship
0.1	0.4	each
0.2	0.4	trunk.
0.6	0.6	And
0.6	0.8	then
0.8	0.7	Amazon
0.7	0.7	launched
0.1	0.3	its
0.1	0.1	own
0	0.2	competing
0.5	0.2	products
0.8	0.1	in
0.8	0.3	October
0.2	0.4	2019.
0.9	0.2	That's
0.1	0.3	a
0.3	0.4	major
0.5	0.3	loophole.
0.5	0.2	And
0.5	0.7	I
0.4	1	go
0.2	0.6	back
0.9	0.4	to
0.4	0.1	the
0.6	0	General

0.3	0.3	to
0.1	0.6	this
0.4	0.2	committee
0.6	0.4	very
0	0.2	clearly
0.1	0.4	that
0.3	0.4	there
0.5	0.2	was
0.6	0	no
0.2	0.6	access
0.4	0.9	to
0.5	0.1	this
0.8	0.6	data,
0.4	0.1	that
0.7	0.8	Amazon
0.6	0.2	does
0.9	0.4	not
1	0.2	use
0.8	0.1	that
0.5	0	data
0.3	0.3	for
0.8	0.2	its
0.3	0.8	own
0.1	0.2	benefit.
0.4	0.5	And
0	0.2	I'm
0.9	0.4	now
0.4	0	hearing
0.6	1	you
0.5	0.9	say
0.4	1	well
0	0.3	you're
0.3	0.1	not

0.1	0.6	sure
0	0.9	that
0.3	0.5	that's
0.5	0.6	going
0.3	0.4	on.
0.2	0.8	And
0.6	0.2	the

0.6	0.7	with
0.8	0.4	here
0.8	0.9	is--is
0.8	0.7	very
0.1	0.6	simple.
0.4	0.7	You

0.6	0.3	that

0.1	0.2	on
0.6	0.3	your
0.9	0.8	platforms
0.8	0.1	with
0.4	0.5	whom
0.4	0.3	you
0.7	0.8	compete.
0.3	0.5	You
0.1	0.3	can
0.9	0.5	track
0.7	1	consumer
0.6	0.1	habits,
0.1	0.1	interests,
0.6	0.2	even
0.7	0.7	what

0.7	0.5	but
0.1	0.8	then

0.5	0.9	You

0.4	0.1	Do

0.8	0.1	is
0.6	0.8	expiring--
1	0.8	
0.9	0.6	
0.1	0.7	BEZOS:
0.9	0.9	--I'm
0.8	0.5	sorry.
0.7	0.2	Go
0.9	0.6	ahead.
0	0.7	I
0.5	0.2	didn't--
0.4	0.5	
0.4	0.3	
0.6	0.8	JAYAPAL:
0.5	0.1	--And
0.1	0.9	the
0.1	0.9	question
0	0.2	I
0.6	0.8	wanted
0.4	0.7	to
0.9	0.3	ask
0.3	0.2	you
0.7	0.4	is
0.8	1	that
0.4	0.7	you
0.6	0.4	have
0.5	0.9	access
0.4	0.7	to
0.4	0.8	data
0.5	0.3	that
0.5	0.7	your
0.6	0.2	competitors
0.2	0.5	do
0.7	0.8	not
0.9	0.8	have.
0.2	0.3	So
0.5	0.6	you
0.8	0.5	might
0.6	0.6	allow
0.7	0.7	third-party
0.7	0.5	sellers
0.5	0.7	onto
0.5	0.9	your
1	0.6	platform
0.3	0.6	but
0.7	0	if
0.5	1	you're
0.9	0.8	continuously
0.6	0.7	monitoring
1	1	the
0.9	0.5	data
0.5	0.6	to
0.1	0.3	make
0.8	0.7	sure
0.3	0.4	that
0.3	0.1	they're
0.2	0.3	never
0	0.8	gonna
0.6	0.9	get
0.9	0.7	big
0	0.9	enough
1	0.7	that
0.9	0.2	they
0.6	0.6	can
0	0.7	compete
0.1	0.5	with
0.7	0.8	you,
0.4	0.8	that
0.4	0.4	is
0.7	0	actually
0.3	0.7	the
0.5	0.3	concern
0.9	0.5	that
0.3	0.1	the
0.4	0.7	committee
0.2	0.8	has.
0.7	0.4	And--you
0.9	0.1	know--I
0.1	0.1	think
0.7	0.4	your
0.5	0.3	company
0.4	0.4	started
0.5	0.9	in
0.3	0.1	my
0.1	0.5	district.
0.4	0.3	I
0.7	0.1	want
0.9	0.9	to
0.6	0	thank
0.3	0.8	you
0.9	0.5	for
0.3	0.2	that.
0.4	0.1	I
0.3	0.4	want
0.9	0.6	to
0	0.1	thank
0.8	0.9	you
0.5	0.9	for
0.4	0.5	the
0.5	0.7	work
0.6	0.1	that
0.3	0.8	you've
0.1	1	done.
0.8	0	And
0.1	0.6	say
0.3	0.7	that
0.8	0.3	the
1	0.9	whole
0.9	0.9	goal
0.1	0.4	of
0.8	0.9	this
0.4	0.2	committee's
0.1	0.1	work
0.7	0.3	is
0.1	0.2	to
0.1	0.2	make
0	0.4	sure
0.8	0.4	that
0.1	0.4	there
0.9	0.5	are
0.1	0.8	more
0.5	0.9	Amazons.
0	0.2	That
0	0.6	there
0.3	0.2	are
0.9	0.4	more
0.3	0.4	Apples.
0.5	0.3	That
0.9	0.7	there
0.4	0.5	are
0	0.7	more
0.7	0.7	companies
0.7	0.9	that
0	1	get
0	0.1	to
0.8	0.6	innovate,
0.4	0.4	and
0.3	0.4	small
0.8	0.4	businesses
0.3	0.6	get
0.1	0.5	to
0.7	0.5	thrive.
0.8	0.6	And
0.9	1	that
0.2	0.1	is
0.1	0.3	what
0.8	0.5	we're
0.4	0.3	trying
0.7	1	to
0.8	0.8	get
0.6	0.2	at.
0.2	0.1	That
0.5	0.7	is
0.5	1	why
0.2	0.6	we
0.1	0.1	need
0	0.6	to
0.3	0.9	regulate
0.1	0	these
0.3	0.3	marketplaces
0.9	0.5	so
0.9	0.8	that
0.6	0.5	no
0.2	0.5	company
0.8	0.6	has
0.8	0.7	a
0.6	0.8	platform
0.9	0.9	so
1	0.9	dominant
0.3	0.4	that
0.8	0.4	it
0.2	1	is
0.1	0.7	essentially
0.4	1	a
0.9	0.7	monopoly.
0.8	0.5	Thank
0.7	0.3	you,
0.5	1	Mr.
0.7	0.9	Chairman.
0.6	0.9	I--I
0.3	0.2	yield
0.8	0.8	back.

0.3	0.7	
0.7	0.2	CICILLINE:
0.1	0.6	The
0	1	time
0.5	1	of
0.8	0.6	the
0.8	0.9	gentlelady
0.1	0.6	has
0.7	0.7	expired.
0.6	0.1	I
0.9	0.2	just
0.6	0.8	wanted

1	0	remind
0.5	0.7	the
0.6	0.6	witnesses
0.4	0.1	we
0.2	0.9	appreciate
0.3	0.1	the
0.5	0.6	gratitude
0.5	0.5	for
0.8	0.9	the
0.3	0.4	questions
0.1	0.4	and

0.5	0.4	of
0.5	0.8	them
0.1	0.6	as
0.8	0.2	good
0.3	0.7	questions
0.1	0.4	but
0.5	0.7	we'll
0.3	0.3	just
0.9	0.3	assume
0.5	0.7	that
0.3	0.8	they're
0.6	0.2	good
0.9	0.5	questions
1	0.3	and
0.9	0.2	they're--and
0.5	0.1	you're
0.8	0.7	happy
0.7	0	to
0.2	0.7	answer
0.6	0.8	them
0.8	0.7	so
0.6	0.1	we
0.3	0.5	can
0.3	0.1	make
0.2	0.1	sure
0.7	0.1	we're
0.3	0	making
0.5	0	good
0	0.9	use
0.2	0.4	of
0.4	0.3	your
0.9	0.7	time.
0.7	0.4	And
0.9	0.4	with
0.6	0.3	that
0.8	0.9	I
0.1	0.7	recognize
0.3	0.9	the
0.9	1	gentleman
0.4	0.7	from
0.4	0.1	Florida,
0.8	0.7	Mr.
0.3	0.9	Steube.
0.5	1	
0.5	0.6	
0.8	0.5	STEUBE:
0.6	0.5	Thank
0.9	0.4	you
0.7	0.6	Mr.
0.1	0	Chairman.
0.3	0	Mr.
0.5	0.5	Pichai
0.7	0.6	I'd
0.6	0.1	like
0	0.7	to
0.9	0.2	start
0.6	0.3	with
0.9	0.7	you.
0.3	0.6	And
0	0.8	I'm
0.1	0.4	just
0.2	0.6	gonna
0.5	0.9	illustrate
0.4	0.1	my
0.7	1	question
1	0.6	with
0.1	0.3	a--a
0	0.7	factual
0.8	0.2	incident
1	0.5	that
0.6	0.5	actually
0.2	0.7	occurred
0.3	0.9	to
0.4	0.4	me.
0.3	0.5	Several
0.6	0.3	months
0	0.4	ago
0.3	0.4	my
0.5	0.3	wife
0	0.3	called
0.5	0.2	and
0.9	0.2	said,
0.7	0.3	"Hey
1	0.6	there's
0.2	0.5	a
0.9	0	good
0.7	0.9	article
0.3	0.3	on
0.9	0.8	the
1	0.1	Gateway
0.7	0.8	Pundit
0.6	0.9	that
0.6	0.2	you
0.4	1	should
0.1	0.5	read."
0.2	0.7	So
0.7	0.8	out
0.3	0.8	of
0.5	0.3	curiosity
0	0.1	I
0	0.6	was
1	0.2	up
0.9	0.3	here
0.5	0.9	in
0.2	0.9	Washington--out
0.5	0.5	of
0	0.3	curiosity
0.2	0.5	I
0.7	0.5	googled
0.1	1	Gateway
0.2	0.7	Pundit.
0.7	0	And
0.2	0.9	it
0.1	0.2	didn't
0.9	0.1	show
0.8	0.5	up
0.3	0	on
0.3	0.1	the
0.1	0.7	first
0.8	0.2	page.
0.4	0.3	It
0.5	0.7	didn't
0.5	0.7	show
1	0.7	up
0.1	0.2	on
0.8	0.7	the
0.3	0.8	second
0.1	0.5	page.
0.2	0.2	There
0.9	0.9	was
0.2	0.5	a
1	0.8	bunch
0.6	0.3	of
0.1	0	different
0.1	0.7	blogging
0.6	0.4	sites
0.4	0.1	about
1	0.8	how
0.5	0.6	there
0.3	1	were
0.8	0.2	disagreements
0.6	0.4	with
0.4	0.1	what
0.5	0.1	was
0.8	0.9	on
0.4	0.2	the
0.8	0.1	Gateway
0.4	1	Pundit,
0.8	1	but
0.2	1	I
0.5	0.8	actually
0.5	0.8	had
0.3	0.7	to
0.4	0.1	type
0.8	0.3	in
1	0.7	gateway
0.1	0.7	pundit
0.4	0.7	dot
0.2	0.7	com
0.5	0.6	to
0.3	0.8	get
0.5	0.5	to
0.9	0.3	it.
0.4	0.2	Interestingly,
0.7	0.8	Google
0.5	0.3	didn't
0.6	0.9	allow
0.8	0.3	me
0.2	0.6	to
0.4	0.3	get
1	0.8	to
0	0.8	the
0.8	0.6	actual
0.1	0.5	website.
0.8	0.2	That
0.3	0.1	was
0.4	0.1	a
0.8	0	couple
0.9	0.6	of
0.1	0.3	months
0.5	0	ago
0.1	0	before
0.5	0.6	this
0.6	0.5	hearing
0.9	0.1	was
0.1	0.6	set
0.5	0.7	to
0.8	0.8	be
0.5	0.6	heard,
0.6	0.4	before
0.7	0.1	this
0.2	0.8	hearing
0.3	0.8	was
0.1	0.3	noticed,
0.6	0.4	before
0.8	0	you
0.2	0.9	knew
0.4	0.4	that
0.3	0.7	you
0.7	0.8	would
0.6	0.4	be
0.9	0.8	br--appearing
0.9	0.9	before
0.3	0.5	us
0.5	0.4	today
1	0	and
0.4	0.2	that
1	0	this
0.6	0.5	is
0.1	0.1	an
0.1	0.8	issue
0.7	0.7	that
0.6	0	obviously
0.3	0.4	Conservatives
0.4	1	and
0.7	0.7	Republicans
0.8	0.9	have
0.2	0.6	had.
0.1	0.1	Last
0.9	0	week
0.9	0.8	after
0.2	0.8	the--the--this
0.1	0.3	was
0.6	0.1	noticed--this
0.1	0.4	hearing
0.1	0.4	was
0.7	0.5	noticed,
0	0.4	I
0	0.4	did
0.3	0.8	the
0.5	0.1	exact
0.7	0.5	same
0.9	0.1	thing
0.6	0	here
0.6	0.6	in
0.3	0.1	the
0.3	0.9	capital.
0.3	0.5	And
0.8	0.3	wouldn't
0.8	0.3	you
0.5	0	know
0.2	0.9	it.
0.7	0.5	I
0.5	0.1	googled
0.6	0.8	Gateway
0.9	0.7	Pundit
0.7	0.9	and
0.8	0.7	that
0.9	0.7	was
0.4	0.7	the
0.5	0.5	very
0.1	0	first
0.9	0.1	website
0.7	0.5	that
0.3	0.9	came
0.1	0.1	up.
0.5	0.8	Now
0.2	0.6	this
0.8	0.7	isn't
0.3	0.7	from
0.3	0.9	a
0.4	0.4	constituent
0.2	0.6	in
0.4	0	my
1	0.3	district,
0.5	0.6	this
0.7	0.7	isn't
0.8	0.1	from
0.2	1	somebody
0.6	0.4	telling
0	0.4	me,
0.3	0.7	this
0.4	0.4	isn't
0	0.5	a
0.3	0.6	news
0.6	0	report.
0.7	0.5	I
0.9	0.1	actually
0.6	0.9	physically
0.4	0.3	did
0.7	0.8	this
0.7	0.4	on
0.9	0.9	my
0.9	0.1	laptop
0.7	0.8	here
0.7	0.2	in
0.7	0.7	the
0.3	0.3	capital
0.4	0.5	several
0.6	0.4	months
0.1	0.6	ago
0.9	0.8	and
0.1	0.2	then
0.4	0.8	today.
0.7	0.1	So
0.8	0.3	clearly
0.4	0.6	something
0.2	0.3	had
0.3	0.5	happened
0.3	0.6	between
0.1	0.4	not
0.8	0.3	being
0.3	0.1	notified
0.2	0.7	that
0.3	0.3	you
0.1	0.5	were
0.6	0.8	going
0.8	0.2	to
0.3	0.7	be
0.9	0.7	appearing
0.9	0.5	before
0	0.4	our
0.2	0.5	committee
0.6	0.5	and
0.6	0.5	then
0.1	0.8	last
0	0.7	week
0	0.7	knowing
0.9	0.3	that
0.5	0.8	you
0.1	0.5	would
0.9	0.9	be
0.8	0.8	appearing
0.6	0.6	before
0.5	0.8	our
0.1	0.3	committee
1	0.7	and
0.2	0.5	suddenly
0.1	0.4	conservative
0.2	0.5	websites
0.6	0.5	are
0.6	0.4	now
0.6	0.2	at
0.7	0.9	the
0.6	0.7	top
0.6	0.2	of
0.5	0.9	the
0.7	0.1	bar
0.1	0.6	when
0.9	0.4	you
0.3	0	search
0.6	0.4	for
0.1	0.2	them.
0.4	1	So
0.6	0.5	was
0.2	0.5	there
0.2	0.1	any--anything
0.5	0.3	done
0.2	0.5	at
0.2	0.9	Google
0.4	0.1	between
0.6	0.1	a
0	0.7	couple
0.3	0.8	of
0.6	0.6	months
0.5	1	ago
0.8	0.5	and
0.8	0.6	last
0.5	0.7	week
0.1	0.4	or
0.2	0	the
0.5	1	week
0.4	0.6	before
0.2	0.2	you
0.9	0.9	appearing
0.7	0.9	today
0.5	0.2	that
0.3	0.4	has
0.9	0.8	changed
0.5	0.9	your
0.7	0.3	approach
0.9	0	to
0.8	0.4	silencing
0.8	0.6	conservative
0.4	0.4	websites?
0.7	0.2	
0.9	0.6	
0.9	0.1	PICHAI:
1	0.1	Congressman,
0.3	0.7	we
0.7	1	approach
0.2	0.3	our
0.1	0.4	work
0.9	0.6	with
0.6	0.3	a
0.6	0.4	deep
0.5	0	sense
0.5	0.8	of
0.4	0.9	responsibility
0.6	0.4	without--in
0.8	0	a
0.8	0.8	non-partisan
0	0.7	way.
0.5	0.6	We
0.3	0.1	want
0.2	0.3	to
0.7	0.1	serve
1	0.2	all
0.3	0	our
0.1	0.5	users
0.6	0.2	no
0.6	0.4	matter
0.8	0.3	where
0.9	0.1	they
0.6	0.1	are.
0.7	0	In
0.8	0.3	fact,
0.4	0.5	it's
0.6	0.5	in
0.1	0.4	our
0.1	0.5	long
0	0.6	term
0.3	0.1	business
0.7	0.1	incentive--incentive
0.2	0.2	to
0.6	0.5	do
0.1	0.8	so.
0.6	0.2	And
0.7	0.9	I
0.6	0	believe
0.1	0.8	on
0.9	0.7	our
0.6	0.6	platforms
0.7	0.1	including
0.6	0.8	YouTube
0	0.8	there
1	0.4	are
0.1	0.1	more
0.6	0.9	conservative
0	0	voices
0.5	0.9	than
0.8	0.6	ever
0.9	0.3	before.
0.3	0.8	And--and
0.8	0.9	we
0.9	0.2	believe
1	0.8	in
0.1	0	freedom
0	0.9	of
0.4	0.9	expression.
0.1	0.7	On
0.3	0.4	this
0	0.3	specific
0.1	0.8	issue--you
0.6	1	know--you
0.1	0.9	know--I
0.9	0.9	will
0.5	0.2	have
0.4	0.6	to
0.1	0.2	look
0.1	0.6	into
0.4	0.4	it.
0.6	0.1	You
0.1	0.9	know--I
0.2	0.1	obviously
0.8	0.6	wasn't
0.8	0.9	aware
0.7	0.5	of
0.2	0.7	it.
0.3	0.8	We
0.2	0.3	do--it
0.2	0.8	could
1	0	be
0.2	0.8	a--a
0.8	0.1	number
0.6	0.9	of
0.1	0.9	reasons.
0.2	0.7	We
0.9	0.8	constantly
0.9	0.7	get
0.8	0.7	reports
0.3	0.9	from
0	0.4	both
0.1	0.9	sides
0.8	0.2	of

0.3	0.2	I--I've

1	0.2	a
0.3	0.5	similar

0	0.1	So,
0.8	0.6	I've
0.2	0.4	been

0.4	0.8	politics
0.7	0.4	for

0	0.5	one
0.7	0.3	of

0.6	0.4	called
0.7	0.4	me

0.6	0.4	"Hey,

0.6	0.4	you
0.5	0.4	to
0.1	0.7	know
0.8	0.7	this.
0.5	0.2	That
0.4	0.1	my
0.3	0	Gmail
0	0.5	account
0.1	0.9	suddenly
0.3	0.4	is
0.8	0.3	taking
0.9	0.2	your

0.8	0.5	emails
0.1	0.3	that
0.3	0.8	I've
0.3	1	received
0.1	0.1	for
0.9	0.8	almost
0.5	0.2	10
0.2	0.7	years
0.6	0.6	and
0.7	0.8	suddenly
0.2	0.1	they're
0.5	0.8	going
0.1	0.7	to
0.8	0.3	spam
0	0.6	and
0.7	0.1	junk
0.6	0.1	folders."
0.4	0.7	This
0.9	0.1	is--appears
0.1	0.7	to
0.9	0.4	only
0.2	0.2	be
0.8	0.6	happening
0.7	0.2	to
0	0.2	Conservative
0.9	0.9	Republicans.
0.3	0.7	I
0.9	0.8	don't
0.4	0.7	see
0.7	0.3	anything
0.7	0.9	in
0.4	0.4	the
0.5	0.7	news
0.6	0.9	or
0.3	1	anything

0.1	0.1	side
0.4	0.1	of
0.2	0.6	the

0.6	0.8	talking

0.9	0.1	folders
0.8	0.4	in
0	0.2	Gmail.
0.3	0.5	So
0.5	0.3	my
0.2	0.6	question
0.9	0.3	is--is
0.3	0.6	why
0.7	0.7	is
0.7	0.9	this
0.1	0.6	only
1	0.1	happening
0.4	0.7	to
0.9	0.5	Republicans?
0.7	0.1	And
0.3	0	it's
0.1	0.4	a
0.9	0.2	fact
0.3	0.7	it's
0.1	0.6	happening.
0.1	0.3	Because
0.5	0.5	I
0.6	0.4	can
0.1	0.2	have
0.1	0.5	my
0.6	0.9	supporters
0.5	0.5	testify
0.5	0.2	that
0.1	0.1	they've
0.1	0.5	received
0.5	0.2	my
0.5	0.3	emails
0.8	0.6	for
0	0.7	eight
0.5	0	years--eight,
1	0.3	nine
0.7	0.5	years
0.8	0.7	and
0.4	0.2	suddenly
0.9	0.8	this
0.7	0.7	last
0.9	0.7	year
0.3	0.7	all
0.8	0.8	of
0.8	0.8	their
0.7	0.6	Gmail--my
0.4	0.2	campaign
0.8	0.1	emails
0.7	0.3	in

0.1	0	to
0.4	0.5	their
0.3	0.9	spam
0.7	0.8	folder.
0.9	0.3	So
0.3	0	if
0.3	0.8	you
0.3	0.9	could--if
0.8	0.6	you
0.1	0.8	could
0.7	0.2	give
0.6	0	me
0.8	0.3	some
0.8	0.8	clarification
0.4	0.4	on

0.7	0.7	
0.3	0.5	PICHAI:
0.1	0.7	In--in

0.2	0.3	to
0.2	0.7	a

0.5	0.9	and
0.6	0.3	I
0.4	0.9	quote,
0.3	0.2	"They

0.8	0.7	So
0.2	0.5	in
0.9	0.4	2007,
0.8	0.7	Google's
0	0.5	founders
0.9	0.1	feared
0.8	0.6	making
0.1	1	this
0	0.1	change,
0.4	0.3	because
0.1	0.3	they
0.9	0	knew
0.7	0.3	it
0.6	0.1	would
0	0.6	upset
0.1	0.4	their

0.3	0.4	But
1	0.7	in
0.9	0.7	2016,
0.9	0.9	Google
0.2	0.3	didn't
0.6	1	seem
0.1	0.7	to

0.6	0.5	Mr.
0.9	0.2	Pichai,
0.9	0	isn't
0.3	0.6	it
0.5	0	true
0.9	0.9	that
0.7	0.6	what
0.8	0.2	changed
0.9	0.9	between
0.7	0	2007
0.8	0.9	and
0.4	0	2016
0.6	0.1	is
0.9	0.4	that
1	0.4	Google
0.8	0.3	gained
0.5	0.7	enormous
0.5	0.7	market
0.4	0.6	power.
0.2	0.8	So
0.5	0.2	while

0.8	0.3	care
1	0.9	about

0.6	0.4	
0.5	0.1	PICHAI:
0.6	0.6	Congresswoman,
0.3	0.4	this
0.7	0.4	is

0.4	0.4	issue,
0.7	0.5	if
0.1	0.2	I
0.4	0.9	could

0.4	0	You

0.5	0.2	We

0.2	0.8	that.
0	0.8	I
0.7	0.1	am
0	0.8	concerned
0.3	0.2	that
0.7	1	Google's
0.3	0	bait-and-switch
0	0.5	with
0.3	0.6	Double
0.1	0.4	Click
0.2	0.8	is
1	0.1	part

0.1	0.8	but
0.4	0.5	to

0.8	0.8	In
0.8	0.6	2019,
0.3	0.8	Google

0.3	0	percent?
0.2	0.4	Yeah,
0.3	0.6	okay.
0.1	0.5	And
0.4	0.9	because

0.6	0.6	you

0.6	0.2	I
0.1	0.4	just

0	0.5	sure
0.6	0.8	you're
0.7	0.9	not
0.1	0.6	going

0.1	0.6	it

0.1	0.3	
0.3	0.4	
0.1	0.8	PICHAI:
0.8	0.7	Congressman,
0.9	0.4	I
0.8	0.8	recall
0.1	0.4	our
0.2	1	conversation
0	0.4	at
0.2	0.5	that
0	0.6	time,
0.6	0.4	and
0.9	0.5	I
0.6	0.3	appreciate
0.1	0.3	your
0.3	0.2	concern.
0.2	0.3	We
0.9	0.6	didn't
0.4	0.1	find
0	0.5	any
0.3	0.3	evidence
0.5	0.8	of
0.7	0.7	such
0.4	0.9	activity,
0.6	0.6	and
0.2	0.5	I
0.5	0	took
0.1	0.6	the
0.6	0.1	opportunity,
0.6	1	after
0.3	0.6	our
0.3	0.8	conversation,
0.4	0.9	to
0.6	0.3	reinforce
0.8	0.2	to
0.7	0.3	the

0.8	0.1	realize
0	0.3	even
0.8	0.8	an
0.9	0.4	appearance
0.1	0.7	could
0.8	0.6	be
0.6	0.3	improper.
0.2	0.9	So
0.9	0.3	we
0.6	0.8	have
0.3	0.9	clearly
0.8	0	communicated

0.1	0.3	left
0.9	0.2	or
0.7	0.4	right,
0.5	0.3	needs
0.1	0.2	to

0.6	0.8	on
0.5	0.9	their
0.8	0.6	own
0.1	0.1	time
0.6	0.6	and
0.3	0.1	resources,
0.4	0.6	and
0.6	0.5	should
0.2	0.8	avoid
0.1	0.1	any
0.2	0.8	use
0.6	0.3	of
0.1	0.7	company--
0.7	0.1	
0.3	0.8	
0.8	0.7	JORDAN:
0.4	0.1	--Well,
0	0.3	of
0.1	0.1	course,
1	0.1	everyone's

0.5	0.1	to
0.3	0	campaign
0.1	0.1	for
0	0.7	who
0.4	0.9	they
0.6	0.9	want,
0.7	0.8	what
0.2	0.3	they
0.8	1	can't

0.1	0.1	So
0.9	1	you
0.7	0.7	might
0.1	0.3	have
0.1	0.2	not
0	0.1	have
0	1	found

0.1	0.3	but
0.5	0.9	here's

0.3	0.8	So
0.8	0.6	when

0.2	0.6	Okay

0	0.4	I'm
0.1	0.7	sorry,
0.5	0.4	Mr.

0.7	0.4	I'm
0.5	0.6	almost
0.5	0.7	out
0.3	1	of
0.1	0.3	time.
0.1	0.4	I'm
0.5	0.4	concerned,
0.5	0.8	too,
0.7	1	because
0.7	0.5	especially
0.3	0.6	with
0.3	0	the
0.2	0.4	current
0.6	0.6	pandemic,
0.3	0.7	one
0.8	0.8	of
0.5	0.6	the
0.4	0.2	biggest
0	0.1	needs
0.8	0.2	I'm
0.3	0.4	seeing
0.2	0.3	at
0.5	0.7	the

0.4	0.1	drives

1	0.3	that
0.8	0.4	we're

0.9	0.4	to
0.6	0	run
0.7	0.6	in
0.6	0.8	my
0.3	0.3	district
0.5	0.5	is
0.6	0.4	that
0.5	0.4	families
0.8	0.8	don't
0.4	0.4	have
0.1	0.1	diapers
0.2	0.5	and
0.2	0.6	we

0.5	0.8	them
0.8	0.4	to
0.1	0.9	give
0.1	0.3	them
0.8	0.4	out.
0.6	0.5	So
0.7	0.7	it
0.1	0.6	certainly
0.1	0.9	is
0.3	0.4	some--something
1	0.1	that
0.3	0.4	has
1	0.7	a
0.9	0.9	really
0.9	0.6	hard
0.5	0	impact
0.5	0.7	on
0.4	0.2	families.
0.1	0.5	And
0.8	0.4	I--I'm
0.6	0.7	really
0.7	0.9	concerned
0.9	0.6	that
0.8	0.6	pricing
0.8	0.2	might

0.1	0.8	it's
0.9	0.9	fair
0.4	0.2	to
0.9	0.1	say,
0.1	0.5	I
0.5	0.9	think
0.1	0.2	you'd
0.8	0.9	agree
0.9	0.4	with

0.7	0.9	that
0.6	0.9	you

0.9	0.2	ZUCKERBERG:
0.8	0.7	Congressman,
1	0.7	those

0.8	0.1	at

0.5	0.7	Well,
0.3	0.9	let's
0.1	0.7	talk
0.9	0.1	about
0.5	0.2	that,
0.1	0.6	because
0.4	0.4	by

0.9	0.9	They

0.4	0.6	Facebook,
0.4	0.1	in
0.5	0.5	my
0.4	0.4	view,
0.2	0.2	I

0.7	0.5	by
0.3	0.1	then.
1	0.5	I

0.3	0.2	I--I

0.3	0.2	that's

0.1	0.3	We

0.5	0.2	I

0.9	0.8	I

0.4	0.5	you

0.3	0.8	let's--why
0.1	0.8	don't
0.9	0.2	we
1	0.6	dig
0.8	0.2	into
0.2	0.7	this
0.7	0.5	a
0.6	0.1	bit
0.6	0.6	further?
0.4	0.1	So
0.9	0.6	you
0.9	0.2	and
0.1	0.9	I
0.1	0.8	clearly
0.1	1	disagree
0.6	0.7	about
0.5	0.2	that.
0.5	0.2	In
0.4	0.8	2012,
0.6	0.9	I'm
0.9	0.6	looking
0.4	0.7	at
0	0.7	a
0.9	0.9	document
0.3	0.9	that
0.7	0.8	was
0.4	0.6	produced
0.2	0.6	by
0.2	0.5	Facebook
0.2	0.9	in
0.1	0.7	response
0.8	0.6	to
0.4	0.6	the

0.9	0.7	It's

0.1	1	Sheryl

0.3	0.9	telecommunications
0.6	0.4	firm
0.9	0.2	boasting
0.9	0.8	that,
0.3	0	quote,
0.9	0.7	"Facebook

0.8	0.3	it's

0.3	0.6	I,
0.8	0.1	you

0.2	1	would
0.3	0.7	concede

0.6	0.6	Facebook

0.8	0.5	Would

0.2	0.7	describe
0.1	0.7	as

0.3	0.5	but
0.5	0.7	obviously

0	0.6	So,
0.8	0.7	Mr.
0.7	0.6	Bezos,
0.9	0.9	after
0.6	0.8	Amazon
0.7	0	dis--delisted
0.9	0.7	this

0.8	0.6	business

0.5	0.6	she

0.4	0.1	over

0.1	0.3	Do
0	0.2	you

0.3	0.1	this

0.7	0.3	an

0.2	0.3	appreciate

0.2	0.4	And

0.3	0.7	It--and--and

0.3	0.2	
0.9	0.6	MCBATH:
0.3	0.8	--I
0	0.7	think
0.4	0.1	though
0.3	0.5	that
0.1	0.3	you're
0	0.6	missing
0.3	0	the
0.8	0.5	point.
0.3	0.6	This
0.9	0.3	is
0.8	0.5	not
0.4	0.2	just
0.6	0.7	about
0.4	0.3	one
1	0.6	business.
0.4	0.4	Now
0.8	0.6	I'm
0.8	1	concerned
0.2	0.8	that
0.9	0.7	this
0.1	0.9	is
0.8	0.4	a
0.9	0.3	pattern
0.8	0.3	of
0.4	0.1	behavior
0.2	0.1	and
0.1	0.1	basically
0.1	0.4	this
0.6	0.6	pattern
0.9	0.8	of
0.8	0.1	behavior
0.3	0.8	has
0.8	0.4	to
0.9	0.3	change.
0.9	0.2	Mr.
0.3	0.9	Bezos,
0.8	0.5	my
0.2	0.6	question
0.4	0.9	is
0.9	0.1	simply
0.3	0.1	are
0.4	0.8	you
0.3	0.2	willing
0.7	0.2	to
0	0.3	make
0.3	0.4	sure
0.1	0.1	going
0.9	0.7	forward
1	0.5	that--you
0.5	0.7	know--the
0.8	0.9	numerous
0.1	0.4	sellers
0.6	0.9	that
0.1	0.6	we've
0.8	0.8	talked
1	0.1	to,
0.4	0.8	they
0.2	0.4	have
0.8	0.8	problems
0.6	0.2	just
0.3	0.7	like
0.2	0.9	this.
0.4	0.9	And
0.8	0.1	there
0.7	0.7	are
0.3	0.3	more
0.2	0.4	sellers
0.2	0.1	who
0	0.9	have
0.8	0.7	told
0.3	0.5	us
0.3	0.7	that
0.3	0.5	they
0.2	0.3	have
0.7	0.7	exhausted
0.4	0.5	all
0.8	0.4	of
0.4	0.5	their
0.6	0	options
0.5	0.9	before
0.3	1	finally
0	0.9	reaching
0.2	0.1	out
0.1	0.6	to
0.8	0	you
0.3	0.5	directly
0.6	0.7	as
0.5	0	a
0.4	0.7	last
0.7	1	resort.
0.7	0.5	But
0.8	0.2	they're
0.6	0.2	still
0.9	0.1	waiting
0	0.7	for
0.5	0.3	your
0.7	0.9	response.
0.7	0.2	So
0.6	1	what
0.1	0.5	do
0.8	0.3	you
0.3	0.7	have
0.3	0.5	to
0.9	0.3	say
0.4	0.6	to
0.7	0.7	the
0.7	0.1	small
0.1	0.7	businesses
0.5	0.6	who
0.3	0.6	are
0.4	0.3	talking
0.1	0.5	to
0.2	0.5	Congress
0.6	0.5	because
0.5	0.7	you
1	0	simply
0	0.1	won't
0.5	0.2	listen
0.6	0.4	to
0.4	0.3	them?
0.3	0.4	
0.8	0.2	
0.3	0.3	BEZOS:
0.5	0.5	Well
0.6	1	I'd
0.4	0.5	say
1	0.7	that's
0.3	0.5	not
0.4	0.5	acceptable.
0.3	0.7	If
0.3	0.2	we
0.9	0.2	aren't
0.8	0.7	listening
0.7	0	to
0.6	0.9	you
0.4	0.3	I'm
0.9	0.5	not
1	0.1	happy
0.2	0.2	about
1	0.8	that
0.9	0.8	at
0.3	0.9	all.
0.5	0.2	And
0	0.7	I--but
0	0.7	I
0.6	0.2	do--you
0.8	0.9	know--if
0.3	0.7	you'll
0.1	0.3	allow
0.8	0.8	me
0.6	0.4	to
0.6	0.3	disagree
0.4	0.8	a
0.9	0.3	little
0.5	0	bit
0.3	0.8	with
0.4	0.7	a
0.5	0.1	piece
0.2	0.4	of
0.6	0.1	this,
0.4	0.5	I
0.4	0.8	do
0.6	0.9	not
1	0.6	think
0.4	0.6	that's
0.3	0.3	systematically
0.9	0.5	what's
0.2	0.1	going
0.8	0.6	on.
0.2	0.2	And
0	0.1	the
0.2	0.7	evidence
0.4	0.1	that
0.4	0	I
0.8	0.6	would
0.1	0.8	suggest
0.8	0.4	would
0.6	0.7	be
0.6	0.2	useful
0.5	0.7	for
0.7	0.7	you
0	0.7	to
0.3	0.1	consider
0.7	0.6	in
0.7	0.2	that
0.9	0.5	regard
0.3	0.2	is
0.2	0.7	that
0.4	0.4	third
0.6	1	party
1	0.9	sellers
0.7	0.4	in
0	0.3	aggregate
0.4	0.6	are
0.4	0.1	doing
0.5	0.9	extremely
0.4	0.1	well
0.6	0.3	on
0.1	0.1	Amazon.
0.8	0.9	They
0.5	0.6	grew
0.2	0.5	from
0.8	0.9	20--you
0.9	0.9	know--20
0.4	0.3	years
0.3	0.6	ago
0.4	0	it
0.3	0.3	was

0.1	0.3

0.4	0.9	MCBATH:
0.7	0.3	Thank
0.1	0.8	you
0.3	0.4	so
0.5	0.9	much.
0.5	0.8	You
0.3	0.8	said
0.3	0.9	that
0.4	0.3	sellers
0.8	0.1	have
0.7	0.3	many
0.6	0.3	other
0.9	0.3	attractive
0.6	0.9	options
0.4	0.8	to
0.5	0.5	reach
0.3	0.7	customers,
0.3	0.4	but
0.4	0.2	that's
0.4	0.9	not
0.1	1	at
0.9	0.9	all
0.8	0.7	what
0.1	1	we
0.4	0	found
0.7	0.3	in

0.2	0.3	According
0.6	0.3	to

0.8	0	One
0.9	0.3	seller
0.6	0.1	told
0.4	0.3	us
0.7	0.4	that
0.8	0.5	and
0.3	0.2	I
0.3	0.1	quote,
0.3	0.5	"Amazon

0.5	0.9	great
0.9	0.6	respect
0.9	0.3	I--I
0.6	0.7	do

0.5	0.3	So
0.7	0.4	I

0.8	0.5	that
0.1	0.4	really

0.5	0.3	I
0.8	0.3	want
0.1	0.7	you
0.3	0.8	to
0.9	0.2	pay
0.8	0.6	close
0.5	0.7	attention
0.1	0.3	to
0.1	0.1	how
0.6	0.4	they
0.3	0.8	describe
0.4	0	your
0.2	0.8	partnership,
0.8	0.3	Mr.
0.5	0.7	Bezos.
0.5	0.4	We
0.6	0.5	heard
0	0.2	from
0.6	0.5	a
1	0.4	small
0.7	0.3	apparel
0.1	0.7	company
0.3	0.3	that
0.4	0.7	makes
1	0.9	and
0.7	0	sells
0.7	0.2	what
0.7	0.4	they
0.1	0	call
0.3	0.2	useful
0.2	0.2	apparel
0.8	0.9	for
0.1	0.3	people
0.4	0.1	who
0.9	0.9	work
0.6	0.7	on
0.7	0.3	their
0.8	0.6	feet
0.6	0.9	and
0.6	0.1	with
0.3	0.4	their
0.2	1	hands,
0.4	0.1	like
0.3	0.7	construction
0.1	0.8	workers
0.7	0.1	and
0.5	0.4	firefighters.
0.7	0.8	This
0.7	0.3	particular
0.8	0.7	business
0.8	1	discovered
0.8	0.3	and
0.3	0.6	started
0.4	0.1	selling
0.1	0.7	a
0.3	0.1	unique
0.8	1	item
0.8	0.3	that
0.9	0.6	had
0.7	0.5	been--never
0.8	0.5	been
0.4	0.7	a
0.1	0.1	top
0.4	0.8	seller
0.4	0.3	for
0.7	0.6	the
0.8	0.9	brand.
0.1	0.4	They
0.7	0.8	were
0.5	0.3	making
0.9	0.9	about
0.1	0.3	$60,000
0.3	0.5	a
0	0.5	year
0.6	0.3	on
0.9	0.5	just
0.1	0.8	this
0.8	0.7	one
0.5	0.1	item.
0.5	1	One
0.1	0.4	day
0.4	0.7	they
0.6	0.4	woke
0.2	0.4	up
0.3	0.9	and
0.7	0.9	found
0.3	0.5	that
0.8	0.5	Amazon
0.6	1	had
0.3	0.3	started
0.6	0.3	listed
0.9	0.4	the
0.1	0	exact
0.1	0.9	same
0.7	0.9	product,
0.4	0.8	causing
0.7	0	their
0.1	0.7	sales
0.6	0.1	to
0.4	0.4	go
0.1	1	to
0.2	0.8	zero
0.9	0.5	overnight.
0.9	0.9	Amazon
0.1	0.5	had
0.7	0.5	undercut
0.5	0.5	their
0.8	0	price,
0.4	0.4	setting
0.9	0.5	it
0.1	0.6	below
0.1	0.5	what
0.8	0.3	the
0.4	0.6	manufacturer
0.9	0.6	would
0.7	1	generally
0.1	0.6	allow
0.4	0.1	it
0.4	0.8	to
0.5	0.1	be
0.8	1	sold
0.3	0.4	so
0.8	0.2	that
0.4	0	even
0.6	0.8	if
0.4	0.5	they
0.5	0.5	wanted
0.6	0.9	to,
0.3	0.9	they
0.5	0.5	couldn't
0.9	0.2	match
0.5	0.3	the
0.4	0.7	price.
0.4	0.7	Here's
0	0.8	how
0.3	0.8	the
0.6	0.7	apparel
0.5	0.2	company
1	0.5	described
0.6	0.3	working
0.5	0.7	with
0.3	0	Amazon.
0.7	1	And
0.8	0.5	I
0.7	0.2	quote,
0.9	0.5	"Amazon
0.6	0.2	strings
0.5	1	you
0.8	0.1	along
0.9	0.5	for
1	0.3	a

0.2	0.6	because
0.4	0.9	it
0.7	0.9	feels
0.7	0.9	so
0.9	0.1	good
0.1	0.1	to
0.1	0.6	get
0.9	0.3	that
0.5	0.3	paycheck
0.9	0.9	every
0.4	0.5	week.
0.3	0	And
0.8	0.3	in
0	1	the
0.2	0.5	past,
0.3	0.7	for
0.5	0.9	lack
0.9	0.4	of
1	0.4	a
0.3	0.7	better
0.8	0.9	term,
0.6	0.6	we
0.7	0.2	included
0.1	0.9	Amazon
0	0.6	heroin
0.8	0.9	because
0.2	0.8	you
0.7	0.2	just
0.7	0.1	kept
0.3	0.4	going
0.3	0.7	and
0.2	0.1	you
0.7	0.8	had
0.1	0.2	to

0.7	0.1	your
0.8	0.2	next
0.7	0.9	fix,
1	0.4	your
0.5	0	next
0.5	0.5	check.
0.2	0.3	But
0.6	0.9	at
0.8	0.9	the
0.7	1	end
0.1	0.4	of
0.6	0.6	the
0.3	0.5	day,
0.9	0.1	you
0.6	0.2	find

0.1	0	So
0.2	0.9	Mr.
0.8	0.7	Bezos,
0.8	0.1	this
0	0.1	is
0.2	0.9	one
0.3	0.3	of
0.7	0.6	your
0.6	0.8	partners.
0.2	0.2	Why
0.4	0.4	on
0.8	0.2	earth
0.2	0.7	would
0.9	0.5	they
0	0.7	compare
0.3	0.2	your
0.7	0.8	company
0.2	0.7	to
0.7	0.2	a
0.3	0.2	drug
0.1	0.3	dealer?
1	0.8	
0.2	0.3	
0.9	0.8	BEZOS:
0.2	0.6	Sir,
0.7	0.4	I
0.1	0.6	have
0.7	0	great
0.1	0.7	respect
0.6	0.7	for
0.5	0.4	you
0.8	1	and
0.7	0.6	this
0.5	0.7	committee,
0.1	0.2	but
0.4	0.3	I'd
0.4	0.8	completely
0.8	0.3	disagree
0.2	0.8	with
1	1	that
0.5	0.5	characterization.
0.4	0.1	When
0.2	0.8	we
0.2	0.6	have
1	0.3	done
0.2	0.5	is
0.2	0.5	create
0.4	0.4	in
0.4	0.6	the
0.1	0.8	store
0.7	0.1	a
0.4	0.2	place--if
0.7	0.2	you
0.1	0.3	go
0.4	0.2	back
0.1	0.3	in
0.1	1	time,
0.7	0.6	we
0	0	sold
0.1	0.2	only
0.5	1	our
0.8	0.2	own
0.5	0.1	inventory.
0.8	0.7	It
0.7	0.2	was
0.8	0.9	a
0.2	0.1	very
0.9	0.5	controversial
0.2	0.3	decision
0.6	0.6	inside
0.8	0.8	the
0.3	0.6	company
0.1	0.3	to
1	0.5	invite
0.3	0.1	third
0.9	0.4	party
0.2	0.2	sellers
0.1	0.1	to
0.8	0.2	come
0.7	0.7	into
0.7	0.6	what
0.2	0.5	is
0.5	0.3	really
0.9	0.8	our
0.3	0.9	most
0.4	0.2	valuable
0.1	0.2	retail
0.8	0.1	real
0.8	0.5	estate,
0.7	0.7	our
0.2	0.4	product
0.6	0.3	detail
0.4	0.3	pages.
0.7	0.8	We
0.5	0.8	did
0.7	0.1	that
0.2	0.4	because
0.5	0.1	we
0.4	0.1	were
0.6	0.2	convinced
0.5	0.8	that
0.9	0.5	it
0.8	0.5	would
0.3	0.2	be
0.9	0.7	better
0.1	0.4	for
0.5	0.1	the
0.9	0.8	consumer.
0.2	0.5	It
1	1	would
0.6	0.5	be
1	0.6	better
0.7	0.2	for
0.4	0.5	the
0.2	0.1	customer--
0.3	0.1	
0.4	0.6	
0.4	1	CICILLINE:
0.5	0.9	--Mr.
0.9	0.1	Bezos,
0.4	0.9	this
0.1	0.6	is--
0.5	0.6	
0	0.6	
0.7	0.5	BEZOS:
0.2	0.3	--to
0.8	0.6	have
0.7	0.8	all
0.1	0.9	of
0.9	0.8	that
0.3	0.9	selection.
0.5	1	And
0.4	0.6	I
0.6	0.1	think
0.8	0.8	we
0.1	0.5	were
0.4	0.1	right
0.4	0.8	and
0.8	0.2	I
0.5	0.9	think
0.8	0.9	it's
0	0.4	worked
0.3	0.7	out
0	1	well
0.5	0.4	for
0.4	0	the
0.9	0.8	customer--

0.8	0.8	--Reclaiming

0.9	0.3	this

0	0.8	This
0.7	0.5	is
0.8	0.1	one
0.1	0.8	of
0.4	0.9	many
0.4	0.1	small
0.2	0.1	companies
0.8	0.4	that

1	0.5	us
0.8	0.7	during
0	0.2	this
0.6	0.8	year-long
0.8	0.1	investigation
0.1	0.1	that
0.1	0.5	they
0.7	0.4	were
0.6	0.8	mistreated,

0.2	0.5	and
0.9	0.3	tossed

0.6	0.1	Now
0.1	0	Mr.
0.8	0.2	Bezos,
0.7	0	you
0.2	0.1	said
1	0.4	that
0.1	0.4	Amazon
0.6	0.7	is
0.7	0.9	only
0.3	0.6	focused
0.5	0.8	on
0.5	0.4	doing
0.6	0.7	what's
0.4	0.8	best
0.4	1	for
0.4	0.3	the
0.4	0.7	customer.
0.1	0.5	You
0.5	0.9	just
0.5	0.3	said
0.8	0.8	it

0.6	0.5	party--and

0.3	0.8	You
0.2	0.9	couldn't
0.6	0.3	be
0.7	0.8	certain.
0.1	0.6	Can
0.8	0.1	you
0.6	0.1	please
0.9	0.5	explain
0.8	0.1	that
0.3	0.9	to
0.1	0.4	me?
0.3	0.5	How--can
0.3	0.9	you
0.8	0.4	list
0.1	0.1	examples
0.5	0.2	of
0.3	0.6	which--where
0.5	0.4	the
0.7	0.8	policy
0.4	0.4	has
0.7	0.2	been
0.3	0.6	violated?
0.7	0.1	Because
0.2	0	it's
0.1	0.7	particularly
0.4	0.9	concerning
0.7	1	to
0.1	0.7	me,
0.4	0.9	Mr.
0.2	0.6	Bezos,
0.8	0.7	that
1	0.2	shouldn't
0	0.3	third
0.5	0.8	parties
0.6	0.4	know
0.9	0.4	for
0.7	0.3	sure
0.3	0	that
0.2	0.3	data
0.1	0.3	isn't
0.6	0.2	being
0.9	0.1	shared
0.4	0.8	with
0.8	0.4	your
0.4	0.4	online,
0.7	0.1	their
0.7	0.3	competitors?
0.8	0.3	Why
0.2	0	should
0.9	0.6	a
0.7	0.7	third-party
1	0.8	seller
0.3	0.7	list
0.4	0.6	their
0.3	0.7	product
0.3	0.3	on
0.6	0.5	Amazon
0.4	0.1	if
1	0.1	they're
0.4	0.1	just
1	0.6	going
0.1	0.3	to
0.4	0.6	be
0.2	0.8	undercut
0.6	0.9	by
0.7	0.6	Amazon's
0.5	0.5	own
0.6	0.7	product
0.7	0.7	as
0.2	0.1	well
0.7	0.7	as
0.4	0.1	a
0.9	0.9	result
0.3	0.1	of
1	0.7	data
0.6	0.6	you

0.7	1	
0.8	0.1	
0.4	0.1	BEZOS:
0.1	0.1	So,
0.9	0.7	I
0.6	0.8	think
0.1	0.3	what--what
0.5	0.8	I
0.8	0.8	want
0.6	0	you
0.6	0.8	to
1	0.2	understand
0.3	0.2	I
0.7	0.7	think
0.8	0.7	it's
0.3	0.5	important
0.5	0.3	to
0.5	0.7	understand
0.1	0.5	is
0.6	0.9	that
1	0.9	we
0.1	0.1	have
0.5	0.2	a
0.4	0.6	policy
0.4	0.4	against
0.4	0.3	using
0.8	0.1	individual
0.7	0.2	seller
1	0.1	data
0.1	0.5	to
0.3	0.5	compete
0.2	0	without
0.7	0.3	private

0.3	0.5	products.
0.8	0.3	
0.6	0.9	
1	0.6	CICILLINE:
0.4	0.6	And
0.7	0.7	you
0.8	0.9	couldn't
0.9	0.6	assure
0.7	0.7	Ms.
1	0.1	Jayapal
0.9	0.3	that
0.8	0	that
0.3	0.3	policy
0.4	0.5	isn't
0.8	0.3	violated
0.1	0.1	routinely.
0.6	0.1	
0.7	0.8	
0.9	0.5	BEZOS:
0.4	0.6	Well,
0.8	0.4	we're
0.7	0.6	investigating
0.2	1	that
0.6	0.1	and
0.2	0.6	I--I
0.8	0.8	do
0.2	1	not
0.7	0.8	want
0.1	0.7	to
0.4	0.6	sit
0.1	0.2	here
0.3	0.3	and
0.1	0.8	I
0.3	0.3	do
0.2	0.8	not
0.5	0.6	want
0.2	1	to
1	0.4	go
0.5	0.2	beyond
0.4	0.9	what
0.2	0.3	I
0.1	0.6	know
1	0.6	right
0.6	0.5	now.
0.8	0.9	We
0.8	1	are,
0.7	0.1	as
0.6	0.2	a

0.8	0.1	Journal
0.6	0.8	article,
0.7	0.5	we
0.1	0.9	are
0.2	0.7	looking
0.5	0.3	at
0.9	0.7	that
0.5	0.7	very
0.9	0.6	carefully--
0.8	0.8	
0.4	0.4	
0.8	0.1	CICILLINE:

0.5	0.3	
1	0.7	BEZOS:
0.9	0.8	--And
0.9	0.7	we
0.6	0.8	want
1	0.3	to
0.6	0.3	get
0.9	0.7	this
0.3	0.3	back--
0.9	0.1	
0.5	0.2	
0.4	0.1	CICILLINE:
0.6	0.7	--The
0.1	0.4	evidence--
0.6	0.7	
0.5	0.6	
0.6	0.8	BEZOS:
0.3	0.6	--And
0.1	0.4	I
0.8	0.6	will
0.4	0.2	surely
0.4	0	share
0.4	0.5	them
0.1	0.4	with
0.6	0.5	you--
0.3	0.8	
0.2	0.2	
0.9	1	CICILLINE:
0.8	0.6	--Thank--thank
0.2	0.6	you.
0.7	0.5	And
0.8	1	we
0.6	0.6	look
0.9	0.2	forward
1	0.1	to
0.9	0	that.
0.2	0.5	The
0.3	0.3	evidence
0.6	1	we've
0.6	0.5	collected
0.8	0.2	shows
0.7	0.2	that
0.5	0.5	Amazon
0.7	0.3	is
0.6	0.2	only
0.1	0.5	interested
0.5	0.6	in
0.4	0.1	exploiting
1	0.5	its
0.4	0.6	monopoly
0.5	0.2	power
0.9	0.3	over
0.4	0.1	the
0.6	0.9	e-commerce
0	0.6	marketplace
0.5	0.5	to
1	0.7	further
0.1	0.1	expand
0.9	0.3	and
0	0.7	protect
0.5	0.3	its
0.9	0.4	power.
0.1	1	This
0.1	0.9	investigation
0.9	0.4	makes
0.3	0.3	clear
0.7	0	that
0.3	0.1	Amazon's
0.1	0.2	dual
0.3	1	role
0.7	0.3	as
0.9	0.4	a
0.7	0.1	platform
0.9	1	operator
0	0.7	and
0.7	0.4	competing
0.9	0.8	seller
0.2	0.9	on
0.8	0.6	that
0.8	0.1	platform
1	0.1	is
0.3	0.7	fundamentally
0.6	0.7	anticompetitive
0	0.8	and
0.6	0.7	Congress
0.3	0.9	must
0.2	0.1	take
0.1	0.7	action.
0.2	0.4	And
0.2	1	with
0.1	0.4	that,
0.1	0.6	I
0.3	0.4	recognize
0.1	0.8	the
0.5	0.2	gentleman
0.2	0	from
0.3	0.8	Wisconsin,
0.8	0.5	the
0.8	0.3	ranking
0.3	0.6	member
0.8	0.1	of
0.3	0.4	the
0.8	0	subcommittee,
0.3	0.8	Mr.
0.6	0.6	Sensenbrenner
1	0.6	for
0.3	0.1	five
0.1	0.6	minutes.
0.4	0.2	
0.5	0.6	
0.5	0.9	SENSENBRENNER:
0.7	0.7	Mr.
1	0.6	Chairman,
0.3	0.9	I
0.1	0.9	think
0.9	0.3	that
0.7	0.5	that
0.5	0.3	history
0.9	0.8	proves
0.6	0.5	that
0.1	1	Congress
0	0.7	does
0.3	0.9	a
0.1	0.1	poor
0.8	0	job
0.1	0.7	in
0.6	0.1	picking
0.6	0.6	winners
0.1	0.7	and
0.9	0.3	losers
0.5	0.3	and
1	0.8	I've
0.3	0.8	looked
0.2	0.7	over
0.4	0.5	a
0.3	0.9	lot
0.8	0.2	of
0.6	0.7	the
0.8	0.4	material
0.3	0.4	that
0.8	0.8	has
0.7	0.5	been
0.4	0.7	assembled.
0	0.7	I've
0.1	0.7	been
1	0.6	working
0.9	0.4	with
0.3	0.1	the
0.4	0.1	chairman
0.7	0.1	for
0.3	0.5	over
0.5	0.7	a
0.1	0.3	year
0.2	0.5	on
0.2	0.5	this
0.2	0.6	bipartisan
0.9	0.5	investigation
0	0.2	and
0.7	0.7	I
0.2	0.2	have
0.3	0.5	reached
0.1	0.2	the
0.1	0.1	conclusion
0.3	0.2	that
0.7	0.5	we
0.7	0.4	do
0.4	0.7	not
0.3	0.8	need
0.1	0.6	to
1	0.2	change
0.7	0.3	our
0.2	0.4	antitrust
0.6	1	laws.
0.8	0.7	They
0.1	1	have
0.8	0.3	been
0.3	0.4	working
0.1	0	just
0.7	0.6	fine.
0.7	0.6	The
0.8	0.2	question
0.3	0.2	here
0.6	0.3	is
0.1	0.8	the
0.6	0.3	question
0.8	0.6	of
0.5	1	enforcement
0.4	0.8	of
0.9	0.1	those
0.5	0.1	antitrust
0.6	0.8	laws.
0.7	0.9	Now,
0	0.9	we've
0.5	0.7	heard
0.2	0.7	a
0	0.5	lot
0.8	0.6	about
1	1	the
0.2	0.7	Facebook
0.1	0.7	acquisition
0.7	0.6	of
0.6	0.5	Instagram.
0	0.9	That
0.2	0.6	happened
0.1	0.9	in
0.1	0.4	2012.
1	0.6	Obama's
0.7	0.5	FTC
0.2	0.3	signed
0.8	0.5	off
0.2	0	on
0.6	0.2	that.
0.7	0.3	So
0.6	0.8	regardless
0.3	0.6	of
0.7	0.3	what
0.3	0	you
0.4	0.4	think
0.1	0.1	has
0.7	0.9	happened
0	0.4	at
0.7	0.7	that
0.1	1	time,
0.8	0.3	the
0.6	0.9	fact
0.3	0.2	is
0.9	0.3	is
0.8	0.9	that
0.9	1	this
0.3	1	acquisition
0.1	0.4	did
0.5	0.5	pass
0.9	0.3	the
0	0.5	smell
0	0.1	test
0.8	0.4	of
0.6	0.4	the
0.7	0.8	regulators
0.9	0.4	involved.
0.1	0.3	Maybe
0.2	0.8	they
0.9	0.8	made
1	0.7	a
0.6	0.2	mistake
0.9	0.2	or
0.2	1	maybe
0.1	0.7	something
0.9	0.4	else
0.4	0.5	happened.
0.3	0.9	I
0.7	0.2	don't
0.6	0.9	know,
0.4	0.1	but
0.1	0.9	the
0.8	0.3	fact
0.2	0.8	is
0.7	0	is
0.8	0.4	that
0.2	0.2	there
0.7	0.4	is
0.4	0.1	not
0.5	0.7	a
0.4	0.8	problem
0.2	0.9	with
0	0.2	the
0.7	0.3	law.
0.5	0.2	Now,
0.4	0.9	you
0.4	0.9	know,
0.3	0.5	back
0.1	0.7	about
0.3	0.4	35
0.2	0.1	years
0.8	0.6	ago,
0.8	0.7	AT&T
0.3	0.5	was
0.8	0.4	broken
0.1	0.9	up
0.5	0.1	because
0.6	0.9	it
0.7	0.3	was
0.4	0.6	determined
0.1	0.6	that
0.8	0.4	one
0.4	0.3	stop
0.1	0.5	shops
0.4	0	were
0.8	0.1	monopolistic
0.1	0.3	and
0.9	0.7	AT&T,
0.8	0.6	because
0.6	0.1	you
0.6	0.7	have
0	0.9	to
0.1	0.3	get
0.9	0.5	your
0.1	0.8	long
0.1	0.5	distance
0.1	0	service
0.1	0.3	from
0.1	0.1	your
0.2	0.6	local
0.6	0.3	phone
0.2	0.2	company,
0.8	0.4	that
1	0.9	was
0.3	0.9	monopolistic.
0.2	0.7	So
0.4	0.3	the
0.5	0.9	baby
0.9	1	bells
0.3	0.4	(SP)
0.7	0.1	were
0.2	0.9	spun
1	0.6	off.
0.8	0.6	A
0.4	0.6	lot
0.2	0.6	has
0.8	0.9	happened
0.6	0.2	since
0.3	0.9	then.
0.6	0.3	There
0.4	0.2	were
0.3	0.5	mergers
0	0.2	and
0.9	0.8	acquisitions
0.6	0.7	in
0.5	0.2	the
0.1	0.1	telecom
0.8	0.3	industry.
0.2	0.2	Technology
0.3	0.5	advanced
0.1	0.4	a
0.7	0.4	huge
0.6	1	amount
0.9	0.8	and
0.2	0.8	guess
0.6	0.5	what?
0.1	0.9	We're
0.2	0	back
0.2	0	to
0.3	0.8	exactly
1	0.1	where
0.7	0.3	we
0.8	0.4	were
0.2	0.3	in
0.6	0.6	1984.
0.2	0.7	So
0.2	0.6	this
0.5	0.1	goes
0.1	0.3	to
0.4	0.2	show
0.6	0.9	that
0.5	0.1	congressional
0.5	0.1	pressure
0.1	0.3	is
0.7	0.5	not
0.3	0	the
0.4	0.1	best.
0.3	1	Now,
0.9	0.5	using
0.6	0.1	the
0.9	0.7	AT&T
0.4	0.8	example,
0.4	0	which
0.4	0.7	I
0.4	0.3	think
0.3	0.4	was
0.6	0.3	a
0.9	0.8	big
0.7	0.2	flop
0	0.7	and
0.2	0.8	counterproductive,
0.9	0	let
0.1	0.2	me
0.7	0.1	ask
0.4	0.9	Mr.
0.9	0.8	Bezos,
0.7	0.5	you
0.8	0.7	know,
0.6	0.4	say
0.3	0.8	the
0.7	0.6	AT&T
0.8	0.3	example
0.4	0.5	was
0.9	0.2	applied
1	0	to
0.8	0.5	Amazon
0.8	0.9	and
0.1	0.3	you
0.5	0.8	were
0.9	0.3	required
0.9	0.3	to
0.2	0.7	spend
0.2	0.6	stuff
0.5	0.7	off.
0.4	0.9	So
0.4	0.1	you
0.3	0.4	might
0.8	0.6	have
0	1	no
0.7	0.8	more
0.2	0.7	of
0.8	0.5	the
0.7	0.2	one
0.4	0.8	stop
0.9	0.1	shop,
0.1	0.3	but
0.7	0.6	you
0.2	0.4	have
0.3	0.7	to
0.5	1	go
0.2	0.9	to
0.2	0.8	separate
0.8	0.4	places
0.7	0.2	for
0.1	0.8	books
0.7	0	or
0.3	0.5	groceries
0	0.5	or
0.3	1	videos
0.1	0.9	or
0.5	0.5	electronics.
0.9	0.7	How
0.2	0.5	are
0.6	0.4	the
0.2	0.9	consumers
0.6	0.8	helped
0.3	0.4	by
0.1	0.7	that?
0	0.4	
0.1	0.2	
0.9	0.5	BEZOS:
0.6	0.8	Sir,
1	0.7	thank
0.6	0.5	you.
0.6	0.6	They
0.4	0.5	would
1	0.2	not
0.6	0.9	be.
0.2	0.3	
0.8	0.2	
0.8	0.1	SENSENBRENNER:
1	0.6	Right.
0	0.6	
0.9	0.1	
0.5	0	BEZOS:
0.6	0.2	Very
0.5	0.7	clear.
0.6	0.2	
0.9	0.6	
0.1	0.7	SENSENBRENNER:
0.6	0.4	Now
0.5	0.1	Mr.
0.3	0.1	Pichai,
0.1	0.2	let
0.9	0.8	me
0.8	0.4	ask
0.8	0.8	about
0.7	0.8	Google.
0.9	0.7	If
0.2	0.2	you
0.3	0.7	were
0.8	0.8	forced
0.4	0.9	to
0.8	0.5	split
0.7	0.2	up
0.7	1	your
0.6	0.6	business
1	0.2	lines,
1	0.6	say
0.3	0.7	spin
0.6	0.7	all
0.8	0.7	Adtech
0.5	0.9	(SP)
0.9	0.7	and
0.5	1	YouTube,
0.7	0	can
0.6	0.9	you
0.6	0.2	describe
0.3	0.8	what
0.3	0.3	happens
0.3	0.7	to
0.2	0.4	consumers
0	0.4	there?
0.5	0.5	
0.6	0.1	
0.1	0.4	PICHAI:
0	0.1	Congressman,
0.2	0.4	today
0.6	0.2	consumers

0.4	0.8	most
0.8	0.2	of

0.7	0.3	we

0.9	0.4	they
0.3	0.7	see

0.7	0.4	than
0.8	1	ever
0.8	0.2	before.
1	0.8	So
0.8	0.6	I
1	0	think--I
0.2	0.3	think
0.5	0	it
0.6	0.7	serves
0.1	0.7	them
0.6	0.9	well.
0.3	0.5	
0.2	0.2	
0.9	1	SENSENBRENNER:
0	0.4	And
0.1	1	you
0.2	1	are
0.9	0.3	right
0.7	0.6	there.
0.9	0.2	So
0.5	0.7	you
0.3	0	know,
0	0.7	I--I'm
0.2	0.1	not
0.4	0.2	going
0.2	0.3	to
0.7	0	be
0.3	0.3	on
0.7	0.2	this
0.1	0.7	committee
0.3	0.8	in
0.2	0.7	the
0.3	0.9	next
0.8	0.1	Congress.
0.9	0.9	I
0.1	0.7	am
0.3	0.5	going
0.7	0.2	to
0.7	0.7	put
0.9	0.6	my
0.2	0.3	feet
0.8	0.3	up
0.2	0.8	and
0	0.5	become
0.8	0.5	a
0.8	0.3	senior
0.3	0.4	"statesman."
0.7	0.3	But
0.7	0.7	you
0.1	0.4	know,
1	0.5	let
0.7	0.6	me
0.8	0.4	say
0.1	0.5	that
0.1	0.9	we
0.6	0.5	have
0.9	0.1	heard
0.8	0.7	a
0.2	0.9	lot
0.3	0.1	of
0.9	0.7	complaints
0.9	0.7	about
0.6	0.5	big
0.1	0.2	tech.
0.4	0.9	Some
0.5	0.8	of
0	0.5	them
0.7	0.8	are
0	0	political
0.1	0.9	in
0.5	0.1	nature
0.8	0.8	and
0.7	0.5	I
0.6	0.9	share
0.2	0.7	the
0.8	0.2	complaints
0.2	0.3	and
0.5	0.3	the
0.5	0.6	concern
0.5	0	of
0.4	0.6	Mr.
0.2	0.1	Jordan
0.8	0.1	and
0	0	others.
0.6	0.5	And
0.6	0.1	others
0.5	0.1	talk
0.9	0.3	about
0.4	0.4	allegedly
0.1	0.2	anticompetitive
0.3	0.3	activity.
0.8	0.7	It
0.9	0.9	seems
0.4	0.8	to
0.1	0.4	me
0.2	0.6	that
0.2	0.3	it's
0.6	0.1	not
0.1	0.5	for
0.8	0.8	Congress
0.4	0.6	that
0.9	0.1	legislates
0.3	0.8	to
1	1	toss
0.9	0.9	all
0.3	0.3	of
0.3	0.8	our
1	0.9	antitrust
0.4	0.1	laws
0.3	0.7	in
0.4	0.9	the
0.8	0.1	precedent
0.9	0.2	that
0.6	0.3	has
0.3	0.3	been
0.3	0.1	established
0.7	0.1	through
0.5	0.8	litigation
0.8	0.3	over
0	0.4	the
0.3	0.1	last
0.9	0.1	100+
0.4	0.8	years.
0.1	0.3	But
0.3	0	it's
1	0.5	something
1	0.8	where
0.8	0.4	we
0.3	0.8	ought
0.4	0.7	to
0.7	0	go
0.1	0.9	back
0.6	0.4	to
0.6	0.5	the
0.3	0.3	regulators,
0.4	0.2	to
0.1	0.4	the
0	0.3	enforcers,
0.6	0.5	have
0.6	0.5	them
0.3	0.8	look
0.7	0.4	at
0.1	0.9	this
0.5	0.8	stuff
0.4	0.5	and
0.7	0.8	have
0.4	0.2	them
0.3	0.5	make
0.5	0.3	a
0.9	0.9	determination
0.9	1	on
0.1	1	whether
0.5	0.7	or
0.1	0.5	not
0.7	0	the
0.7	0.5	law
0.4	0.2	has
0.1	0.4	been
0.8	0.4	violated.
0.8	0.5	I
0.1	0.9	think
0.1	0.2	the
0.3	0.3	law
0.1	0.2	is
0.1	0.9	good
0	0.1	on
0.1	0.8	that
0.8	0.9	and
0.3	0.1	we
0.6	0	don't
0.5	0.9	need
0.6	1	to
0.7	0.1	throw
0.8	0.5	it
0.1	0.8	all
1	0.1	in
0.2	0.5	the
0.1	0.1	wastebasket.
0.7	0.5	But
1	0.9	there
0.3	0.4	are
0.9	0	some
0.2	0.3	matters
0.9	0.5	of
0.6	0.8	concern
0.4	0.3	that
0.3	0.7	we've
0.5	0.5	heard
0.3	0.6	from
1	0.4	both
0.1	0.4	sides
0.9	0.9	of
0.2	0.5	the
0.7	0.6	aisle
0.2	0.3	that
0.3	0.3	I
0.7	0.7	think
0.4	0.9	need
0.9	0.7	to
0.7	0.1	be
0.2	0.1	addressed.
0.8	0.7	And
0.5	0.3	if
0.1	0.2	it
0.7	0.9	requires
0.4	0.3	an
0.9	0.6	agency
0.7	1	like
0.4	0.1	the
0.3	0.9	FTC
1	0.9	to
0.8	0.5	say
0	0	that
0.8	0.4	they've
0.8	0.8	made
0.3	0.9	mistakes
0.2	0	in
0.7	0.4	the
0	0.3	past,
0.1	0.7	so
0.8	0.4	be
0.3	0.3	it.
0.9	0.7	We're

0.4	0.9	We
0.5	0.7	all

0.5	0.1	And
0.1	0.8	even
0.8	0.8	government
0	0.2	agencies
0.7	0.8	do
1	0.8	that.
0.8	0.9	I

0.1	0.3	I

0.4	0.5	the
0.4	0.4	question
0.7	0.1	again
0.5	1	here
0.7	0.5	is
0.6	0.3	when
1	0.3	the
0.6	0.6	dominant

0.5	0.1	threatens
0.5	0.4	its

0.4	0.5	that

0.7	0.1	be
1	0.2	a
0.3	0.9	normal
0.2	0.5	business
0.6	0.3	practice.
0.1	0.7	Facebook
0.1	0.6	is
0.1	0.6	a
0.7	0.6	case
0.5	0.7	study
0.4	0.3	in
0.1	0.2	my
0.1	1	opinion
0.1	0.4	in

0.7	1	because
0.3	0.4	your

0.7	0.6	harvest
0.4	0.5	and
0.7	0.8	monetizes
0.4	0.5	our
0.8	0.5	data,
0.5	0.6	and
0.9	0.9	then
0.2	1	your
0.1	0.6	company
0.9	0.3	uses
0.8	0.5	that
0.6	0.9	data
0.5	0.9	to
0.1	0.5	spy
0.5	0.2	on
0.3	0.6	competitors
0.1	0.8	and
0.7	0.2	to
0.4	0.1	copy,
0.1	0.1	acquire,
0.5	0.9	and
0.3	0.7	kill
0.9	0.4	rivals.
0.5	0.7	You
0.9	0.6	have
0.6	0.6	used
0.8	0.6	Facebook's
0.9	0.3	power
0.2	0.7	to
0.2	0.9	threaten
0.8	0.1	smaller

0.5	0.5	always

1	0.8	your

0.3	0.4	These
0.6	0	tactics
0.6	0.6	reinforce
0.1	0.9	Facebook's
0.1	0.3	dominance,
0.3	0.9	which

0.7	0.3	BEZOS:
0.3	0.4	I'm

0.8	0.7	they're
0.6	0.7	underway
0.9	0.1	right

0.5	0.5	I

1	0.9	And
0.6	0.9	I
0.5	0.3	think
0.1	0.5	this
0	0.6	is
0.6	0.1	kind
0.9	0.3	of
0.6	0.5	two
0.3	0.9	large
0.7	0.4	companies
0.1	0.7	negotiating

0.9	0.6	is
0.9	0.1	kind
0	0.3	of
0.8	0.1	normal
0.8	0.3	case
0.9	0.9	of--it's
0.5	0.5	normal

0.7	0.9	
0.2	0.5	RASKIN:
0.6	1	Right.
0.8	0.8	But--and
0.2	0.6	here--here's
0.8	0.5	why
0	0.3	I
0.7	0.5	pursue
0.5	0	it,
0.4	0.9	precisely
1	0.4	because
0	0.1	it
0.7	0.7	is
0.2	0.9	a
0.9	0.5	large
0.8	0.6	company.
0.9	0.1	And
0.2	0.6	in
0.3	0.2	a
0.9	0.8	way,
0.6	0.3	they
0.8	0	stand

0.6	0.1	position
0.4	0.9	with
1	0.4	respect
0.9	0.3	to
0.1	0.7	negotiating
0.6	0.1	with
0.4	0.8	you.
0.4	0.5	I
0.8	0.6	guess
0.9	0.9	the--the
0.6	0.1	general
0.1	0.6	proposition
0.3	0	then
0.7	0.1	you
0.9	0.9	can

0.2	0.9	which
0.9	0.6	is

0.8	0.1	But
0.9	0.7	the
0.2	0.7	most
0.3	0.1	common

0.3	0.9	they've

0.1	0.9	Maybe
0.2	0.7	they

0.1	0.8	mover.
0.5	0.6	There

0.1	0.2	Lofgren
0.3	0.3	that

0.8	0.1	So,
0.7	0.7	help

0.1	0.5	understand

0.2	0.3	
0	0.8	
0	0	PICHAI:
0.7	0.7	Congressman,
0.4	0.8	there
0.6	0.6	are
0.9	0.4	two
0.6	0.9	parts
0.5	0.8	to
0.7	0.1	this.
0.4	0.6	In
0.8	0.6	general,
0.2	0.8	you
0.9	0.9	know,
0.1	0.6	we
0.1	0.8	algorithmically
0.4	0.6	approach
0.8	0.2	our
0.1	0	search
0.1	0.9	results.
0.1	1	We
0	0.6	have
0.8	0.8	robust
0.4	0.7	policies
0.6	0.5	to
0.4	0.5	do
0.7	1	so.
0.3	0.3	And
0.5	0	we
0.9	0.3	test
0.9	0.9	it
0.6	0.5	both
0.7	0.2	with
0.4	0.8	user
0.2	0.8	feedback
0.8	0.9	and
0.9	0.9	we
0.7	0.8	use
0.7	0.2	raters
0	0.8	to
0.1	0.4	validate.
0.4	0.5	Last
0.8	0.3	year
0.8	0.3	alone,
0.1	0.8	we
0.2	0.2	ran
0.6	0	over
0.8	0.2	300,000
0.7	1	experiments
0	0.2	and
1	0.4	launched
0.4	0.5	around
0.2	0.7	3,000
0.6	0.2	improvements
0.4	0.3	to
0.5	0.1	search.
0.9	0.4	And
0.8	0.7	we
0	0.6	don't
0.4	0.5	manually
0.9	0	tune.
0.1	0.3	The
0.1	0.7	question
0.4	0.7	last
0.6	0.1	time
0.2	0.9	was
0.5	0.8	in
0.4	0.3	the
0.6	0.3	context
0.8	0.7	of
0.2	0.7	is
1	0.7	there
0.6	0.4	someone
0.5	0.1	behind
0.4	0.7	the
0.3	0	curtain,
0.2	0.8	you
0.3	0.3	know,
0	0.6	manually
0.4	0.6	tuning
0.6	0.3	an
0.1	0.1	individual
0.5	0.7	search
0.3	0.2	result.
0.1	0.6	We
0.7	0.1	don't.
0.6	0.9	We
0.7	0.8	generally
0.3	0.2	approach
0.6	0.8	it
0.1	0	algorithmically.
0.7	0.8	We,
0.5	0.5	however,
0.7	0.4	in
0.5	0.5	order
0.5	0.4	to
0.1	0.8	comply
0.7	0.6	with
0.4	0.9	the
1	0	law
0.7	0.7	in
0.2	0.1	every
1	0.2	country
0.4	0.9	we
0.5	0.5	operate
0.6	0.5	in,
0.1	0.9	for
0.4	0.5	example,
0.7	0.6	there
0.8	1	may
0.3	0.7	be
0.3	0.2	an
0.3	0.1	actor
0.5	0	or
1	0.1	a
0.4	0.2	website
0	0.8	identified
0.8	0.3	as
0.4	0.4	interfering
0.4	0.9	in
0.7	0	elections,
0.2	0.2	and
0.2	0.4	we
0.1	0.4	then
0.2	0.1	have
1	0.5	to
0.2	0.5	put
0.8	0.4	that
0.4	0.6	site
0.8	0.7	on
0.7	0.3	a--on
0.8	0.6	the
0.1	0.2	list
0.3	0.5	so
0	0.2	that
0.5	0.1	that
0.1	0.6	doesn't
0.6	0.8	appear
0.1	0.9	in
0	0.7	our
0.2	0.1	search
0.4	0.4	results
0.8	0.9	against
0.4	0.1	queries.
0.8	0.2	So,
0.5	0.6	other
0.1	0.1	examples
0.3	0	would
0.7	0.8	be
0.9	0.2	violent
0.3	0.4	extremism,
0.9	0.3	(INAUDIBLE)--
0.2	0.3	
0.6	0.1	
0.4	0.9	GAETZ:
0	0.5	--And
0.9	0.1	is
0.3	0.1	that
1	0	done

0.8	0.6	Mr.
0.2	0.9	Pichai?
0.3	0.8	That--that
0.3	0.6	process
0.5	0.5	you
0.7	0.4	described,
0.2	0.3	is
0.4	0.9	that
0	0.3	done
0.9	0.4	manually?
0.6	0.1	
0.4	0.3	
0.1	0.9	PICHAI:
0.1	0.3	And--and
0.1	0.7	we
0.9	0.8	could
0.8	0.2	get

0.6	0.5	from
0.9	0.9	law
0.2	0.7	enforcement
0.8	0.3	agencies.
0.9	0.5	You
0.8	0.3	know,
0.4	0.1	we
0.5	0.1	are
0.9	0.1	complying
0.6	0.5	with
0.7	0.4	our--it's
0.5	0.3	a

0.3	0.7	
0.1	0.3	
1	0.7	GAETZ:
0.2	0.1	There
0.7	0.1	is
0.4	0.9	either
0.5	0.6	a
1	0	manual
0.4	0.4	component
0.5	0.3	or
1	0.6	there

0.2	0.2	Which
0.6	0.5	is
0.6	0.6	it?
0.7	0.2	
0.5	0.4	
0.7	0.3	PICHAI:
0.5	0.2	For--for
0.6	0.8	creating
0.8	0.9	those
0.7	0.4	lists,
0.7	0.5	that
0.9	0.8	process
0	0.2	can
0.2	0.5	involve
0.1	0.7	manual
1	1	portions
0.2	0.8	too.
0.6	0.7	
0.5	0.1	
0.7	0.7	GAETZ:
0.6	0.6	Okay,
0.3	0.6	great.
0.9	1	Well,
0.2	0.2	that--that
0.5	0.6	is
0.5	0.1	sort
0.7	0.7	of
0.7	0.7	the
0.4	0.1	concern
0.1	0.6	that
0.3	0.2	I
0	0.6	have.
0.9	0.9	You've
0.6	0.9	now
0.9	0.4	said
0.9	0.5	something
0.9	0.7	different
0.9	0.9	today
0.9	0.5	than
0.3	0.8	you
0.8	0.1	said
0.7	0.6	to
0.9	0.1	Ms.
0.8	0.5	Lofgren,
0.3	0.2	because
0.4	0.2	you've--you've
0.8	0.9	confessed
0.6	0.2	that
0.5	0.1	there
0.8	0.8	is
0.6	0.6	a
0.3	0.3	manual
0.6	0	components
0.4	0.2	to
0.9	0.8	the
0.3	0.4	way
0.9	0.5	in
0.2	0.1	which
0.2	0	you
1	0.7	blacklist
0.8	0.2	content.
0.2	0.1	And
0.4	0.1	it--it
0.3	0.1	seems
0	0.1	to
0.3	0.7	be
0	0.4	no
0.3	0.9	coincidence
0.6	0.9	that
0.9	0.3	it's
0.7	0.6	sites
0.8	0.3	like
0.5	0.7	Gateway
0.2	0.7	Pundit,
0.4	0.7	the

0.5	0.3	American

0.2	0.2	Daily

0.2	0.6	and
0.5	0.8	Breitbart
0.1	0.3	that
0.3	0.3	received
0.4	0.3	the
0.6	0.8	ire
0.8	0	or
0.8	0.5	the
0.2	0.7	negative
0.5	0.6	treatment
0.5	0.6	as
0.2	0.9	a
0.5	0.3	consequence
0.9	0.3	of
0.9	0.2	your
0.2	0.1	manual
0.5	0.5	tooling
0.4	0.9	and
0.9	0.8	it
0.1	0.7	also
0.7	0.3	seems
0.2	0.3	noteworthy
0.5	0.3	that
0.1	0.2	whistleblowers
0.9	0.2	at
0.4	0.4	your
0.9	0.3	own
0.2	0.9	company
0.6	0.3	have
0.1	0.9	spoken
0.8	0	out.
0.7	0.6	You
0.6	0.7	said
0.6	1	that
0.9	0.4	one
0.8	0.1	of
0.6	0.1	the
0.4	0.9	reasons
0.2	0.3	you
0.5	0.4	maintain
0.8	0.1	this
0.9	0.9	manual
0.9	0.7	tool
1	0.6	is
0.7	0.9	to
0.8	0.1	stop
0.4	0.9	election
0.9	0.8	interference.
0.2	0.3	I
0.4	0.1	believe
0.1	0.4	it
0.9	0.4	is
0.9	0.3	in
0.5	0.1	fact
0.7	0.8	your
0.6	0.9	company
0.9	1	that
0.4	0.8	is
0.2	1	engaging
0.7	0.7	in
0.7	0.2	election
0.8	0.4	interference.
0.3	0.8	And
0.1	0.2	it's
0.6	0.8	not
0.6	0.6	just
0	0.3	my
0.4	0.7	view.
0.2	0.4	Mike
0.3	0.9	Wacker
0.8	0.5	came
0.6	0.8	out
0.7	0.8	and
0.6	0.8	was
0.8	0.7	a
0.5	0.7	whistleblower
0	0.7	indicating
0.1	0.6	that
0.8	0.7	that
1	0.6	may
0.9	0.7	blacklist
0.3	0.4	targets
0.2	1	that
0.6	0.9	Google
0.6	0.6	specifically
0.2	0	goes
0.1	0.3	after
0.1	0.2	those
0	0.9	who
0.5	1	support
0.7	0.5	President
0.4	0.4	Trump,
0.8	0.1	who
0	0.9	held
0.7	0.5	a
0.5	0.5	conservative
0.8	0.6	viewpoint,
0.8	0.2	and--and
0.1	0.1	he
1	0.7	left
0.6	0.5	your
0	0.2	company
0.8	1	in
0.7	0.7	20--2019
0.6	0.3	because
0.4	0.3	he
0.9	0.8	was
0.6	0	speaking
0.8	1	out
0.3	0.9	against
0.8	0.9	these
0.1	0.4	outraged
0.3	0.6	mobs.
0.7	0.9	So
0.3	0.4	you
0.3	0.8	can
0.6	0.1	you
0.4	0.5	see
0.3	0.6	how
0.2	0.7	when
0.5	0.3	you
1	0.8	empower
0.5	0	individuals,
0.4	0	some
0.7	0.9	of
0.5	0.7	the
0.6	0.9	same
0.2	0.2	individuals
0.4	0.5	that

0.7	0.9	Mr.

0.6	0.4	there--there

0.9	0.4	is
0.7	0.5	a

0.8	0.7	Yet
0.6	0	yesterday,
0.9	0.9	I
0.8	0.7	was

0.1	0.3	a

0.4	0.3	And
0.4	0.4	when
0.9	0.2	I
0.4	0.2	clicked
0.4	0.2	on
0.9	0.1	the

0.6	0.1	it
0.3	0.7	was
0.2	0.8	taken
0.9	0.7	down
0.3	0.8	and
0.3	0.3	then
0.8	0.5	I
0.7	0.4	was

0.6	0	it

0.2	0.9	I

0	0.8	make
0	0.8	sure
0.9	0.4	and
0.4	0.8	it
0.1	0.9	says

0.4	0.7	How

0.8	0.4	they

1	0.9	for
0.1	0.9	the

0.9	0.1	of

0.1	0	violate

0.9	0.1	
0.2	0.5	
0.8	0.7	PICHAI:
1	0.3	Congressman,
0.8	0.8	we--we
0	0.1	believe
0.3	0.4	in
0.3	0.7	freedom
0.9	0.7	of
0.1	0.5	expression
0.5	1	and
0	0.5	there
0.3	0.8	is
0.9	0.3	a
0.2	0.6	lot
0.4	0.9	of
1	0.7	debate
0.4	0.7	on
0.1	0.4	YouTube
0.6	0.7	about
0.9	1	effective
0.7	0.8	ways
0.1	0.7	to
0.4	0.5	deal
0.2	0.9	with
1	0.5	COVID.
0.7	0.3	We
0.8	0.4	allow
0.5	0.8	robust
0.1	0.7	debate,
0.7	0.1	but
0	0.5	in
0.8	0.6	the
0.5	0.5	area
0.8	0	during
0.5	0.2	a
0.3	1	pandemic,
0.6	0.4	we
0.3	0	look
0	0.3	to
0	0.7	local
0.6	0.4	authorities.
0.8	0	So
0.2	0.5	for
0.1	0.8	example,
0.9	1	in
0.6	0.5	the
0.4	0.8	U.S.
0.5	0	it
0.2	0.4	would
0.1	0.2	be

0.2	0.8	around
0.1	0.8	medical
0.9	1	misinformation
0.5	0.5	in
0.8	0.7	a

0.8	0.3	way,
0.8	0.5	which
0.9	0.8	could

0.5	0.2	in
0.7	0	the
0.6	0.9	real
0.6	0.6	world.
0.1	0.9	And--and
0.5	0.9	so
0.7	1	for
0.9	0.9	example,
0.1	0.2	if
0.2	0.1	there
0.8	0.6	is
0.6	0.8	aspects
0.2	0.3	of
0.8	0.9	a
0.1	0.2	video
0.4	0.2	and
0.2	0.8	if
0	0.3	it
0.4	0.8	explicitly
0.4	0.7	states
0.4	0.8	something
0.7	0.6	could
0.2	0.8	be
0.7	0.5	a
0.5	0.7	proven
0.3	1	cure
0.4	0.4	and
0.9	0.1	that
0.3	0.7	doesn't
0.6	0.6	meet
0.1	0.1	CDC
0.2	0	guidelines,
0.8	0.6	you
0.9	0.7	know,
0.1	0.5	we
0.3	0.7	would
0.5	0.3	remove
0.3	0.5	that
0.6	0.7	video
0.9	0.3	
0	0.8	
0	0.9	STEUBE:
0.4	0.4	It--it's
0.2	0.3	free
0.5	0.8	expression
0.6	0.9	of
0.3	0.4	speech
1	0.6	and
0.8	0.3	you
0.3	0.4	have
0.7	0.7	these
0.6	0.3	doctors
0.2	0.7	who
0.4	0.9	are
0.8	0.2	giving
0.7	0.8	their
0.6	0.1	opinion
0.5	0.7	as
0.7	0.1	doctors.
0.8	0.1	And
0.9	0.8	I
0.1	0.7	don't
0.8	0.4	understand
0.3	0.8	why
0.3	1	YouTube
0.8	0.3	and
0.6	0.8	therefore
0.1	0.7	Google
0.6	0.9	thinks
0.6	0.7	it's

0.3	0.5	physicians
0.6	0.8	and
0.4	0	their

0.2	0	I'm
0	0.8	going
0.1	0.2	to
0.7	0.1	switch
0.6	0.8	quickly
1	0.7	to
0.7	0.3	Mr.
0.4	0.6	Zuckerberg.
0.7	0.5	I
0.6	0.5	think
0.2	1	at
0.1	0.7	this
0.9	0.8	point
0.1	0.4	it's
0.8	0.4	fairly
0	0.4	obvious
0.5	0.4	that
1	0.2	technology
0.7	1	platforms
0.7	0.8	have
0.9	0.9	been
0.9	0.6	stifling
0.7	0.3	conservative
0.3	0.6	news
0.6	0.5	and
0.2	0.6	opinions.
0.7	0.3	You
0.6	0.9	employ
0.7	0.6	a
0.5	0.6	panel
0.8	0.1	of
0.7	0.5	content
0.2	0.8	moderators.
0.4	0.7	Can
0.1	0.1	you

0.7	0	chooses
0.3	0.8	who
0.9	0.4	these

0.1	0.1	are?

0.2	0.3	
0.3	0.5	ZUCKERBERG:

0.2	0.6	We--our

1	0.3	is--is

0.6	0.7	We
0.5	0.5	wanted

0.1	0.1	I

0.3	0.3	And
0.9	0.7	we

0.4	0.2	Congressman,
0.6	0.7	I

0.9	0.4	them
0.1	0.9	on

0.3	0.1	
0.8	1	ZUCKERBERG:
0.2	0.8	Yes.
0.8	0.6	Thanks.
0.2	0.5	We
0.7	0.1	work
0.2	0.7	with

1	0.7	fact
0.8	0.2	checking

0.6	0.5	around
0.8	0.7	the

0.2	0.7	And
0.4	0.6	the
0.6	0.6	goal
0.8	0.6	of
0.9	0.8	the
0.9	0.5	program
0.2	0.4	is
0.2	0	to
0.6	0.6	limit
0.2	0.8	the
0.1	0.4	distribution
0.4	0.7	of
0.8	0.8	viral

0.2	0.2	So
0.6	0.1	things
0	0.1	that
0.2	0.3	are--are
0.8	0	clearly
0.3	1	false
0.9	0.2	from--from

0.3	0.2	a--a
0.7	0.4	lot
1	0.3	of

1	0.5	But
0.2	0.2	we
0.5	0.2	don't
0.7	0.6	ourselves
0.4	0.7	want
0.6	0.4	to

0.5	0.7	That
0.3	0.7	feels
0.5	0.5	like

0.2	0.6	role
0.3	0.8	for

0.6	0.3	We

0.4	0.7	It

0.4	0.9	Was

0.1	0.3	gate
0.6	0.1	for

0.7	0	for

0.6	0.6	appearing
0.7	0.5	before
0.5	0.5	us
0.8	0.9	today
0.4	1	that
0.4	0.7	it's
0.2	0.3	not

0.3	0.4	to
0.7	0	our
0.4	0	economy
0.1	0.6	and
0.5	0.5	competition,
0.8	0.8	but
0.7	0.5	it's
0.8	0.3	harmful
0	0.2	to
0.8	0.6	the
0.2	0.1	founding
0.3	0.3	principles
0.7	0	of

0.4	0.9	whatever
0.6	0.9	the

0.1	0.9	My
0.7	0.7	first
0.6	0.7	question
1	0.9	is,
0.1	0.3	Mr.
0.3	0.7	Zuckerberg,
0.1	0.8	do
0.5	0.3	you
0.2	0.7	agree
0.4	0.3	with
0.2	0.5	that
0.2	0.9	principle,
0.8	0.8	that
0.2	0.1	there
0.4	0.7	are
0.1	0.1	limits
0.8	0.4	to
0.9	0.5	harmful
0.1	1	and
0.7	0.1	fast
0.3	0.7	speech
0.6	0.7	and
0	0.2	that--that
0.1	0.5	are
0.7	0.8	particularly
0	0.8	important
0.5	0.3	when
0.8	0.3	it
0.2	0.2	comes
0.9	1	to
0.7	0.5	the
0.2	0.5	health
0.2	0.2	and
0.6	0.7	safety
0.6	0.4	of
0.3	0.5	the
0.5	0.8	public?
0.3	0.5	
0.9	0.8	
0.9	0.9	ZUCKERBERG:
0.9	0	Congressman,
0.5	0.8	I--I
0.5	0.8	certainly
0.2	0.3	do,
0.4	0.1	and
0.8	0	I
0.3	0.5	actually
0.9	0.1	think
0.9	0.7	that
0.3	0.3	our
0.5	0.5	policies
0.4	0.1	go
0.7	0.1	further
0.9	0.7	than
0.5	0.6	just
0.3	0.6	limiting
0.8	0.2	those
0.7	0.2	types
0.8	0.6	of
0.1	0.6	things.
1	0.8	
0.5	0.8	
0.1	0.1	CICILLINE:
0.3	0.8	Well
0	0.3	Mr.
0.3	0.4	Zuckerberg,
0.2	0.4	you
0.6	0.4	have
0.8	0.4	a
0.1	0.8	billion

0.6	0.8	and
0.2	0.9	almost
0.2	0.6	50,000
0.8	0.8	employees
0.2	1	and
0	0.5	so
0.5	0.4	you
0.4	0.3	agree
0.7	0.5	you
0.6	1	have
0.8	0.8	a
0.3	0.2	responsibility
0.3	0.9	to
0.5	0.7	remove
0.7	0.3	harmful
0.1	0.2	rise

0.9	0.6	
0.5	0.1	
0.5	0.2	ZUCKERBERG:
0.2	0.1	Congressman,
0	0.2	I
0.8	0.1	think
0.7	0.3	we
0.3	0.8	have
0.7	0.3	a
0.4	0.8	responsibility
0.2	0.9	to--to
0.1	0	limit
0.8	0	the
0.4	0.9	spread
0.9	0.4	of--of
0.2	0	content
0.8	0.9	that's
0.3	1	going
0.8	0.5	to
0.6	0.9	be

0.7	0.4	for

0.9	0.5	Also,
0.1	0.8	if--if--I'd
0.4	0.1	like
0.3	0.7	to
0.3	0.4	add
0.6	0.7	that
0.7	0	I
0.7	0.4	do
0	0.2	not
0.6	1	believe
0.3	0.8	that
0.1	0.4	we
0.5	0.1	have
0.5	0.8	any
0.2	0.2	incentive
1	0.1	to
0.7	0.9	have
0.6	0.6	this
0.2	0.7	content
0.8	0.3	on
0.3	0.1	our
0.1	0.2	service
0.3	0.6	people
0.2	0.5	don't
0.1	0.8	like--
0.1	0.8	
0.1	0.3	
0.3	0.8	CICILLINE:
0.2	0.8	--Except
0.2	0	that--wait,
0.8	1	Mr.
0.5	0.1	Zuckerberg,
0.9	0.2	with
0.3	0.4	all
0.3	0.2	due
0.9	0.2	respect,
0.2	0.5	except
1	0.9	that
0.8	0.1	it
0.2	0.1	is
0.4	0.8	often
0.8	0.5	the
0.7	0.7	most
1	0.1	engaging.
0.6	0.5	It's
0.7	0.7	the
0.1	0.1	most--it
1	0.7	brings

0.2	0.5	brings

0.5	0.4	which
0.7	0.9	of

1	1	produces
0.3	0.3	great
0.8	0.2	profit.
0.9	0.4	So
0.5	0.7	you
0.4	0.9	do
0.5	0.8	have
0.6	0.5	an
0.8	0.5	incentive.
0.3	0.1	The

0.9	0.1	Facebook
0.4	0.4	these--these

0.3	0.5	You

0.7	0.1	Isn't

0.3	0.9	true?

0.7	0.5	ZUCKERBERG:

0.3	0.3	I--I

0.4	0.6	I
0.7	1	think
0.2	0.4	every

0.6	0.4	to

0.4	0.7	that

0.9	0.3	to
0.3	0.2	do,
1	0.7	that

0.1	0.3	doing.
0.6	0.5	And
0.3	0.3	I--I
0.7	0.7	think
0.9	0.6	in--in
0.3	1	general,
0.6	0	that
0.6	0.2	allowed
0.1	0.9	us
0.9	0.4	to

0.1	1	services
0.9	0.7	better
0.4	0	for
0.2	0.1	people
0.3	0.6	to

0	0.5	Congressman,

0.7	0.7	grab?
0.2	0.1	
0.8	0.2	
0.3	0.1	ZUCKERBERG:
0.5	0.1	Congressman,
0.4	0.9	I'm
0.6	0.7	not
0.8	0.8	sure
0.5	0.4	what
0.3	0.1	you're
0.6	0.7	referring
0.6	1	to.
0.2	0.5	
0.9	0.2	
0.7	0.1	GAETZ:
0.3	1	Well,
0.2	0.5	in
0.9	0.7	the
1	0.6	emails
0.9	0.7	that
0.8	0.3	your
0.9	0.6	company
0.7	0.5	produced
0.2	0.6	to
0.6	0.9	the
0.6	0.5	committee,
0.1	1	there's
1	0.4	one
0.5	0.9	from
0.7	0.8	David
0	0.1	Weiner
1	0.3	in
0.2	1	2014
0.3	0.1	where
1	0.1	he
0	1	is
0.2	0.8	describing,
0.6	0.4	under
0.1	0.9	the
0.4	0.5	mergers
0	0.8	and
0.6	0.9	acquisitions
0.2	0.9	advice
0	0.1	within
0.9	1	the
0.2	0.4	company,
0	0.1	that--that
0.4	0.4	you
0.8	0.3	need
0.6	0.3	to

0.5	0.2	in
0.4	0.1	a

0.3	0.1	grab.
0.9	0.7	And
0.5	0.9	he
0.1	0.5	says
0.3	0.3	I
0.7	0.1	hate
0.8	0.7	the
0	0.8	word
0.7	0.5	land
0.4	0.4	grab,
0.1	0.6	but
0.2	1	I
0.1	0.4	think
0.9	0.7	that's
0	0.4	the
0.4	0.6	best
0	0.6	convincing
0.7	0	argument
0.8	0.6	and
0.3	0.8	we
0.5	1	should
0.8	0.8	on
0.9	0.8	that.
0.8	0.8	And
0.7	0.8	it
1	0.5	goes
0.2	0.1	on
0.8	0.9	to
0.8	0.3	describe
0.7	0.3	a
0.7	0.1	strategy
0.8	0.1	where
0.5	0.8	in
0.3	0.5	Facebook
0.3	0.9	would
0.8	0.3	spend
0.1	0.7	5
0.6	0.1	percent
0.1	0.9	to
0.4	0.2	10
0.5	0.8	percent
0.4	0.4	of
0.9	0.2	its

0.8	0.2	cap
0.3	0.8	each
0.5	0.7	year
0.9	0.2	to

0.5	0.9	up
0.4	0.2	its
0.6	0.2	market
1	0.1	position.
0.6	0.5	Does
0.6	0.3	that
0.9	0.8	refresh
0.6	0.9	your
0.1	0.6	recollection?
0.8	0.1	
0.4	0.8	
0.1	0.1	ZUCKERBERG:
0.4	0.9	Yes,
0.8	0.7	Congressman.
0.2	0.2	Thanks
0.9	0.5	for
0.5	0.4	the
0.6	0.7	opportunity
1	0.4	to
0.6	0.6	address
1	0.4	this
0.1	0.8	and--and--and
0.8	0.4	frankly
0.2	0.1	to
1	0.1	correct
0.8	0.6	the
0.3	0.9	record,
0.1	0.6	because
0	0.8	I--I
0.3	0.1	believe
0.8	0.1	that
0.3	0.3	what
0.2	0.6	he
0.1	0	was
0	0.4	referring
0.3	0.4	to
0.7	0.8	was
0.7	0.6	a
0.3	0.9	question
0.9	1	that
0.2	0.2	was
0.3	0.6	incoming
0.3	0.8	from
0.7	0.4	investors
0.8	0.2	about
0.3	0.3	whether
0.6	0.8	we
0	0.9	would
0.9	0.8	continue
0.3	0.7	to
0.6	0.3	require
0.3	0.5	different
0.1	0.5	companies.
0.2	0.7	I
0.7	0.4	don't
0.3	0.2	think
0.9	0.2	that
0.2	0.6	that
0.1	1	was--that
0.2	0.9	wasn't
0.5	0.7	referring
0.3	0.3	to
0.4	0.2	an
0.7	0.1	internal
0.3	0.9	strategy.
0.9	0.7	It
0.8	0.5	was
0.6	0.1	referring
0.6	0.8	to
0.8	0.7	an
0.9	0.9	external
0.6	0.2	question
0.4	0.1	that
0	0.5	we
0.5	0.7	were
0.9	0.6	facing
0.8	0.8	about--about
0.2	0.3	how
0.7	0.7	we
0.1	0.4	would--how
0.2	0.6	investors
0.3	0.9	should
0.4	0.5	expect
0.3	0.8	us
0.6	0.3	to--to
0.9	0.4	act
0.2	0.2	going
0.9	0.2	forward.
0.5	0.7	And
0.4	0.3	I
0.1	1	think
0.9	0.5	he
0.5	0.1	was
0.6	0.6	discussing
0.6	0.8	the
0.9	0.9	fact
0.5	0.3	that,
0.3	1	as
0.4	0.3	mobile
0	0.6	phones
0.2	0.9	were
0.4	0.4	growing
0	0.6	in
0.6	0.8	popularity,
0.5	0.8	there
0.3	0.1	were
0.7	0.6	a
0	0.1	lot
0.6	0.6	of
0.2	0.3	new
0.8	0.6	ways
0.5	0.1	that
1	0.7	people
0.8	0.2	can
1	1	connect
0.9	0.7	and
0.4	0.3	communicate
0.8	0.4	that
0.2	0.2	were
0.3	0.9	part
0.7	0.8	of
0.1	0.8	this
0.5	0.9	overall
0.7	0.3	broader
0.1	0.5	space
0.4	0.3	and
0.3	0.6	market
0.7	0.1	around
0.3	0.9	human
0.1	1	connection
1	0.5	and
0.9	0.9	helping
0	0.1	people
0.6	0.7	stay
0.4	0	connected
0.2	0.1	and
0.8	0.4	share
0.1	0.6	their
0.1	0.6	experiences
0.2	0.1	that
0.1	0.7	were--
0.4	0.1	
0	0.8	
0.1	0	GAETZ:
0.5	0.2	--Okay.
0.3	0.5	Well,
0.2	0.1	Mr.--Mr.
0.5	0.8	Zuckerberg,
0.5	0.5	it--it
0.7	0.8	seems
0.1	0.4	to
0.6	0.6	be
0.9	0.7	both
0.4	0.8	internal
0.4	0.4	and
0.3	0.8	external,
0.6	0.2	because
0.2	0.2	then
0.1	0.1	in
0.6	0.7	an
0.8	0.1	email
0.9	0.1	from
0.8	0.6	you
0.1	0.8	in
0	0.4	2012,
0.9	0.8	we
0.1	0.7	see
0.3	0.9	a
0.3	0.9	similar
0.3	0.5	sentiment
0	0.8	expressed.
0.8	0.9	You
0.1	0.5	write
0.2	0.9	we
0.1	0.3	can
0.3	0.2	likely
0.3	0.9	always
0.3	0.3	just
0.8	0.7	by
1	0.3	any
0.6	0.4	competitive
0.7	0.9	startups.
0.2	0.5	So,
0.4	0	is--is
0.5	0.3	your
0.3	0.8	desire
0.4	0	to
0.9	0.3	limit
0.6	0.2	competition
0.2	0.9	by--by
0.8	0.8	purchasing
0.5	0.6	your
0.9	0.7	competitors
0.3	0.3	consistent
0.9	0.2	with
0.5	0.5	the
0	0.7	message
0.3	0.5	to
0.8	0.8	your

0.8	0.8	that

0.4	0.4	
0.2	0.3	
0.6	0.4	ZUCKERBERG:
0.7	0	Congressman,
1	0.1	I--I
0.6	0.1	am
0.5	0.9	not
0.2	0.6	sure
0.2	0.9	I
0.4	0.3	agree
0.2	0.6	with
0.6	0.6	the--the
0.2	0.7	characterization
0.6	0.7	of
0.1	0.7	how
0.1	0.8	we
0.8	0	communicate
0.3	0.7	with
0.8	0.7	investors.
0.1	0.6	But
0.5	0.3	I--
0.8	0.7	
0.4	1	
0.9	0.5	GAETZ:
0.8	0.8	--It's
0.8	0.1	your

1	0.5	Mr.
0.2	0.9	Zuckerberg--
0.5	0.6	
0.5	0.8	
0.3	0.9	ZUCKERBERG:
0.9	0.7	--But
0.2	0.6	I
0.2	0.3	think
1	0.8	the
0.8	0.9	broader
0.4	0.6	point
0.7	0.4	is
0.7	0.3	that
0.7	0.1	there
0.5	0.6	were
0.1	0.6	a
0.7	0.7	lot
0.5	0.7	of
0.9	0.3	new
0.2	0.2	ways
0.8	0.9	that--that
0.8	0.3	people
0.1	0.9	can
0.9	0.4	connect
0.3	0.4	that
0.5	0.7	were

0.5	1	and
0.9	0.4	we--
0.3	0.6	
0.4	0.8	
0.1	0.9	GAETZ:
0.3	0.3	--But
0.5	1	this
0.4	0.4	is
0.7	0	about
0.5	0.6	your
0.9	0.7	merger

0.8	0.9	acquisition
0.3	0.6	strategy.
0.7	0.7	You
0.1	0.5	went
0.2	0.9	on
0	0.6	to

0.1	0.3	one
0.9	0.4	thing
0	0.8	about

0.5	0.6	is
0.1	0.6	you
0.3	0.3	can
0.8	0.8	often
0.1	0.9	acquire
0.1	0	them.
0.6	0.7	So,
0.4	0.5	I
1	0.6	mean,
0.4	0.1	I--I'm

0.7	0.3	Mr.

0.6	0.8	The--the

0.6	0.6	is
0.7	0.6	a

0.3	0.3	Mr.
0.2	0.5	Pichai,
0.9	1	in
0.3	0.5	2015,
0.6	0.2	Google
0.6	0.9	announced
0.1	0.3	that
0.8	0.7	it
0.1	0.5	would
0.6	1	not
0.2	0.2	allow
0.1	0.8	third
0.1	0.2	parties
0.3	0	to
0.7	0.8	buy
0	0.8	YouTube
0.8	0	ads
0.2	0.8	via
0.4	0.4	Adax.
0.7	0.9	That
0.6	0.2	means
0	0.7	that
0.6	0.8	ad
0.6	0.2	buys
0.6	0.9	on
0.1	0.3	YouTube
0.2	0	are
0.5	0.6	conducted
0.5	0.9	only
0.7	0.4	through
0.5	0.3	Google
0.9	0.9	demand-site
0.2	0.5	products.
0.1	0.9	Google
0.8	0.2	justified
0.5	0.2	this
0.9	0.3	change
0.7	0.4	by
0.2	0.3	citing
0.9	0.9	privacy
0.8	0.5	and
1	0.3	user
0.3	1	experience.
0.9	0.8	My
0.6	0.9	understanding
0.3	0.2	is
0.4	0.7	that
0.8	0.4	Google
0.4	0.9	cited
0.7	0.2	a
0.5	0.8	concern
0.4	0.9	that
0.6	0.3	third-party
0.8	0.4	digital
0.6	0.9	and
0.2	0.6	participants
0.7	0.6	would
0.1	0.8	develop
0	0.8	user
0.1	0.5	profiles
0.3	0.9	based
0.4	0.5	on
0.2	0.9	this
0.5	0.7	viewing.
0.8	0.6	It
0.7	0.5	is
0.3	0.5	also
0.9	0.5	my
0.2	0.5	understanding
0.1	0.3	that
0.6	0.1	even
0.5	0.4	under
0.9	0.1	the
0.8	0.2	GDPR,
0.9	0.9	you
0.9	0.7	are
0.8	0.2	allowed--you
0.3	0.6	allow
0.1	0.9	users
0.1	0.2	to
0.7	0.3	provide
0.9	0.3	consent,
0.4	0.9	which
0.3	0.9	would
0.1	0.8	authorize
0.9	1	this
0.6	0.3	type
0.7	0.5	of
0.9	0.9	activity.
0.8	0.1	It
0.6	0.9	seems
0.1	0.3	that
0.1	0.1	if--that
0.6	0.8	this
0.6	0	policy,
0.1	0.3	regardless
1	0.2	of
0.4	0.6	the
0.7	0.1	privacy
0.2	0.9	concerns
0.4	0.8	reduced
0.4	0.9	competition
0.6	0.8	for
1	0.7	demand
0.3	0.2	side
0.3	0	platforms
1	0.5	on
0.3	0.1	YouTube.
0.6	0.7	Do
0.8	0.9	you
0.2	0.2	agree?
0.9	0.2	
0.6	0.7	
0	0.4	PICHAI:
1	0.1	Congressman,
0.3	0.5	we're
0.9	0.2	always
0.6	1	looking
0.7	0.1	to
0.6	0.6	improve
0.9	0.9	the
0.1	0.8	YouTube
0.6	0.7	experience.
0.8	0.9	Part
0.4	0.1	of
0.3	0.6	being
1	0.9	able
1	0.5	to
0.8	0.4	integrate
0.6	0.2	that
0.3	0.8	space
0.5	0.3	while
0.2	1	in
0.1	0.6	YouTube,
0.4	0.9	we've
0.4	0.3	been
0.8	0.3	able
0.9	0.6	to
0.6	0.3	innovate
0.5	0.2	something
0.8	0.4	called
0.8	0.1	true
0.4	0.4	view
1	0.7	adds.
1	0.8	So
1	0.9	for
0.8	1	users,
0.5	0.8	we
1	0.2	give
0.5	0.6	them
0.1	0.5	scalable
0.1	0.3	ads
0.4	0.3	if
0.3	0.4	they
0.6	0.2	find
0.1	0.6	that
0.9	0.6	not
0.4	0.2	to
0.9	1	be
0.5	0.9	relevant,
0	0.6	they
0.9	0.4	can
0.1	0.4	skip
0.9	0.9	past
0.1	0.9	those
0.1	0.6	ads
0.7	0.6	and,
0.7	0.5	you
0.7	0.5	know,
0.6	0	monetizing
0.3	0.6	YouTube
0.5	0.4	is
0	0.6	what
0.8	0	allows--today,
0.8	0.7	we
0.6	0.5	have
0.1	0.4	many,
0.3	0.8	literally
0.6	0	hundreds
0.3	0.7	of
0.2	0.9	thousands
0.8	0.2	of
0.6	0.4	creators
0.8	0.5	earning
0.6	0.9	a
0.7	0.6	livelihood
0.9	0.8	and
0.7	0.4	many
0.3	0.7	of
0.1	0.8	them
0.1	0.6	are
0.8	0.2	small
0.9	0.7	and
0	0.3	medium
0.5	0.1	businesses.
0	0.2	So
0.9	0.4	we
0.4	0.9	want
0.7	0.5	to
0.5	0.3	support
0.3	0.2	that
0.7	0.6	well
0.1	0.3	and
0.9	0.9	so
0.4	0.8	we
0.4	0.3	are
0.7	0.5	focused
0.2	0.4	on
0.5	0.3	that.
1	1	Allowing
0.3	0.8	this
0.4	0.4	type
0.9	0.4	of
0.9	0	integration
0.3	0.5	is
0	0.9	what
1	0.5	allows
0.4	0.3	us
0.2	0.2	to
0.5	0.9	create
0.6	0.1	that
0	0.7	user
0.5	0.5	experience.
0.5	0.2	
0.9	0.7	
0.1	0.8	ARMSTRONG:
0.9	0.8	But
0.3	0.2	after
0.8	1	Google
0.8	0.9	stopped
0.4	0.6	allowing
0.5	0.8	third
0.8	0.6	parties
0.1	0.8	to
0.4	0.3	buy
0.5	0.1	YouTube
0.8	0.5	ads
0.8	0.1	via
0.1	0.5	Adax,
0.8	0.6	Google
0.8	0.7	limited
0.5	0.2	the
0.2	0.4	interoperability
0.3	0.1	of
0.8	0.6	third-party
0.9	0.6	analytics
0.2	0.2	on
0.5	0.4	YouTube.
0.5	0.5	You
0.2	0.1	now
0.6	0	required
0.9	0.4	the
0.7	0.6	use
0.8	0.6	of
0	0.2	ads
0.3	0.3	on
0.5	0.1	data
0.5	0.8	hub.
0.2	0.8	Again,
0.6	0.2	the
0.7	0.8	justification
0.5	0.5	is
0.4	0.5	based
0.2	0.4	on
0.1	0.1	user
0.3	0.2	privacy.
0.8	0.3	Other
0.1	0.8	ad
0.5	0.8	market
0.6	0.2	participants
1	0.9	may
0.3	0.5	not
0.5	0.3	have
0.1	0.7	access
0.5	0.7	to
0.4	0.2	that
0.6	0.5	data,
0.2	0.8	but
1	0.3	it
0.2	0.3	doesn't--it
0.9	0.6	doesn't
0.5	0.5	disappear,
0.1	0.6	does
0.1	0.6	it?
0.9	0.2	
1	0.1	
0.3	0.3	PICHAI:
0.3	0.2	Congressman,
0.5	0.1	this
1	0.1	is
0.2	1	consistent
0.6	0.2	with
0.1	0.3	how
0.7	0.1	to
0	0.3	date
0.9	0	many
0.6	0.1	services,
0.8	0	be
0.7	0.4	it
0.9	0.3	Facebook
0.8	0.4	work
0.3	0.8	Snapchat
0.5	0.7	or
0.1	0.8	Pinterest,
0.3	1	you
0.1	0.2	work
0.3	0.8	with
0.7	0.6	their
0.5	0.3	ad
0.1	0.5	tools
0.6	0.2	to
0.1	0.8	buy
0.3	0.1	ads
0.6	0.8	on
0.7	0	their
0.3	0.6	properties
0.9	0.7	and
0.5	0.7	(INAUDIBLE)--
0.2	0.6	
0.2	0.7	
0.4	0.5	ARMSTRONG:
0.1	0.1	--Well,
0.4	0.7	I
0.3	0.2	understand
0	0.6	that,
0.1	0.2	but
0.3	0.9	the
0.1	0.7	excuse
0.9	0.4	is
0.7	0.1	privacy,
0.6	0.5	but
0.6	0.4	the
0.8	0.5	data
0	0	doesn't
0.1	0.1	disappear.
0.8	0.1	You
0.8	0.2	just
0.6	0.7	have
0.1	0.7	greater
0.3	0.8	control
0.2	1	over
0.4	0.1	it,
0.9	0.8	right?
0.1	0.4	
0.1	0.5	
0.5	0.2	PICHAI:
0.8	0.2	Congressman,
0.2	0.1	it's
0.1	0.3	a
0.9	0.2	service
0.9	0.4	we
1	0.4	provide
0.6	0.2	to
0.4	0.4	our
0.6	0.6	users.
0.5	0	We
0.8	0.5	obviously
0.8	0.1	want
0.4	0.4	to
0.1	0.3	make
0.4	0.1	sure
0.5	0.8	we
0.2	0.1	protect
0.1	0.1	the
0.8	0.8	privacy
0.9	0.5	of
0.6	0.9	users
0.5	0.4	there.
0.4	0.5	We
0.1	0.5	do
0.3	0	monetize
0.6	0.7	with
0.2	0.4	ads.
0.2	1	We
0.7	0.3	give
0.5	0.3	users
0.7	0.6	a
0	1	choice
0.8	0	of
0.7	0.1	either
0.4	1	consuming
0.8	0.9	it
0.3	0.7	as
0.1	0.7	a
0	0.1	subscription
0.7	0.2	service
0.3	0.9	using
0.8	0.6	it
0.6	0.7	with
0.6	0.8	ads
0.7	0.5	and
0.2	0.8	we've
0.7	0.5	been
0.1	0.8	very
0.1	0.8	focused
0.7	0	on
0.8	0.8	making
0.2	0.2	YouTube
0.9	0.1	at
0.6	0.8	great
0	0.2	platform
0.2	0.9	for
0.4	0.9	creators.
0.9	0.3	And
0.9	0.6	I
0	0.1	think
0.8	0.9	the
0.8	0.4	model
0.9	0.9	is
0.7	0.3	working
0.3	0.2	well.
0.1	0.8	It's
0.1	0.1	really
0.4	0.1	helped
0.7	0.8	many
0.6	0.1	small
0.8	0.1	and
0.8	0.8	medium
0.4	0.8	businesses
0.8	0.3	to
0.2	0.8	invest
0.3	0.4	on
0.9	0.3	the
0.5	0	platform
0.4	0	and
0.3	0.3	grow
0.7	0	their
0.2	0.5	businesses.
0.3	0.8	
0.7	0.4	
0.2	0.7	ARMSTRONG:
0.3	0.5	So
0.3	0.9	you
0.5	0.2	would--regardless
0.7	0	of
0.8	0	the
0.9	0.3	intent
0.4	1	was
0.7	0.3	to
0.9	0	lessen
0.1	0.1	competition
0.8	0.6	or
0.8	0	not,
0.6	0.4	the
0.1	0.3	action
0.6	0.3	resulted
0.3	0.1	in
0.3	0.2	smaller
0.2	0.6	competitors
0.3	0.8	unable
0.7	0.5	to

0.3	0.4	in
0.4	0.8	placing
0.5	0.5	ads
0.7	0.3	on
0.5	0.6	YouTube,
0.4	0.3	isn't
0.8	1	that
0.7	0.2	correct?
0.1	0.3	
0.3	0.2	
0	0.4	PICHAI:
0.2	0.4	Congressman,
0.6	0.9	we've
0.8	0.1	seen
0.6	0.1	robust
0.7	0.6	choice
0.6	1	for,
0.6	0.5	you
1	0.4	know,
0.5	0.6	advertisers.
0	0.5	You
0.3	0.4	know,
0.3	0.1	there
0.8	0.8	is
0.5	0.2	several
0.3	0.6	alternatives.
0.8	0.5	There
1	0.6	is,
0.8	0.9	you
0.9	0	know,
0.9	0.3	obviously
0.2	1	Facebook
0.9	0.4	suite
0.5	0.2	of
0.4	0.9	products,
0	0.3	there
0.6	0.1	is
0.9	0.2	Amazon
0.8	0.7	with
1	0.4	their
0.7	0	ads
0.7	0.4	marketplace,
0.6	0.9	there
0.5	0.3	is
0.5	0.5	companies
0.4	0.6	like
0.9	0.2	Snapchat,
0.2	0.3	Pinterest,
0.1	0.9	twitter,
0.1	0.3	there
0.7	0.5	are
0.2	0.3	new
0.4	0.3	competitors
0.3	0.7	have
1	0.5	emerged.
0.3	1	And
0.9	1	this
0.4	0.6	is
0.4	0.9	why
0.8	0.8	boosting
0.3	0.2	advertising
1	0	cost
0.4	0.3	decline
0.7	0.1	by

0	0.4	10
0.7	0.1	years.
0.3	0.1	And
0.3	0.7	so
0.2	0	we
0.3	0.6	see

0.5	0.2	privacy,
0.7	0.3	it's
0.1	0.3	a
0.7	0.5	great
0.2	0.2	word
0.3	0.5	that
0.1	0.5	people
0.5	1	care
0.2	0.3	about,
0.8	0.1	but
0.9	1	not
0.3	0.8	when

0.8	0.6	source
0.9	0.8	if

0.8	0.7	Mr.

0.8	0.6	Mr.

0.6	0.7	
0.7	0.2	ZUCKERBERG:
0.7	0.6	No,
0.4	0.7	Congressman.
0.4	0.9	
0.9	0.5	
0.9	0.7	GAETZ:
0	0.5	And--and
0.1	0.1	so
0.6	0.2	why
0	0.4	would
0.3	0.3	you
0.4	0.2	trust
0.1	0.2	the
0.4	0.4	people
0.8	0.8	who

0.4	0.9	
0.7	0	
0.3	0.5	ZUCKERBERG:
0.3	0.8	Congressman,
0.2	0.7	I'm

0.4	0.3	that
0.3	0.9	you

0	1	you're

0.4	0.2	
0.4	0.7	
0.5	0.2	GAETZ:
0.3	0.9	Oh,

0	0.5	
0.3	0.4	
0	0.1	GAETZ:
0.2	0.4	Okay,
0.9	0.3	that's
0.7	0.3	helpful.
0.5	0.9	
0.1	0.9	
0.2	0.6	CICILLINE:
0.7	0.3	I
0.1	0.3	now
0.7	0.9	recognize
0.6	0.4	the
0.6	0.4	gentleman
0.5	0.5	from

0.9	0.4	
0.6	0.3	
0.5	0.7	RASKIN:
0.7	0.3	Thank
0.1	0.1	you,
0.2	0.3	Mr.

0.4	0.4	I

0.2	0.8	Politics.
0.1	0.5	So
0.8	0.3	I
0.8	0.9	suppose
0.6	0.9	it's
0	0.5	futile
0.6	0.4	to
0.5	0	try
0.8	0.9	to
0.4	0.9	cure
0.6	0.2	the
0.9	0.4	obsessive

0.2	0.6	of
0.7	0.4	some
0.4	0.9	of
0.2	0.7	our
1	0.4	colleagues,
0.1	0.7	but
0	0.3	they
0.7	0.7	should
0.3	0.3	check

0.1	0.7	for
0.1	0.8	the
0.8	0.4	last

0.1	0	And
0.4	0.4	7
0	0.2	or
0.1	0.1	8
0.7	0.7	out
0.2	0.7	of

0.7	0.2	and
0.7	0.3	so
0.1	0.3	on.
0.8	0.6	So
0.5	0.6	if
0.8	0.3	Facebook
0.1	0.4	is
0.6	0.5	out
0.5	0.8	there
0.4	0.7	trying
0.3	0	to
0.8	0.4	repress
0.4	0.8	conservative

0.9	0.9	they're
1	0.6	doing
0.4	0.6	a
0.9	0.3	terrible
0.1	0.6	job
0.1	1	at
0.8	0.2	it.
0.1	0.4	And
0.3	0.4	so
0.9	0.7	I
0.8	0.7	don't
0.6	0.8	understand
0.5	0.5	just
0.6	0.7	the
0.9	0.3	endless
1	0.8	whining
0.9	0.7	about
0.4	0.6	how
0.6	0.6	Facebook
0.2	0.7	and
0.1	0.3	Twitter
0.4	0.2	or
0.7	0.7	Facebook
0.3	0.1	and
0.4	0.8	Twitter
0.4	0.3	are
0.5	0.4	somehow
0.8	0.1	discriminating
0.1	0.2	against--against
0.5	0.1	conservatives.
0.9	0.6	The
0.8	0	removal
0.8	0.8	of
0.3	0.8	Donald
0.8	0.2	Trump
0.9	0.7	and
0.7	0.3	Donald
0.9	0.2	Trump
0.1	1	Jr.
0.9	0.2	from
0.3	0.8	Twitter,
0.3	0.8	their
0.7	0.8	tweets
0.9	0.8	was
0.2	0.3	all
0.8	0.6	about
0.3	0.7	their
0.5	0.7	spreading
0.1	0.7	disinformation,
0.7	0.6	false
0.3	0.2	statements
0.8	0.3	about
0.3	0.7	COVID-19.
0.1	0.7	That
0.5	0.6	was
0.2	0.1	an
1	0.7	absolute
0.9	0.5	public
0.2	0.3	health
0.7	0.5	measure,
0.1	0.1	which
0.5	0.6	I
0.8	0.6	hope
0.4	0	all
0.1	0	of
0.6	0.6	us
0.3	0.5	would
0.2	0.1	endorse.
0.9	0.7	We
0.2	0.4	don't
0.6	0.8	want
0	0.5	anybody,
0.3	0.5	including
0.8	0.5	the
1	0.3	president
0.1	1	of
0.1	0.1	the
1	0.9	United
0.2	0.1	States
0.1	0.3	spreading
0.1	0.5	false
0.5	0.1	information
0.9	0.3	about
0.3	0.8	COVID-19.
0.9	0.8	So
1	0.4	I
0.3	0.6	think
0.2	0.7	they--they
0	0.2	essentially
0.1	0.6	destroy
0.1	0.4	their
0	0.7	own
0.8	0.8	case
0.3	0.5	when
0.5	0.6	they
0.6	0.1	pick
0.3	0.5	that
0.6	0.9	as
0.3	0.1	they
0.8	0.7	are--their
0	0.9	cause
0.5	0.9	for
0.9	0.6	going
0.1	0.7	after
0.4	0.6	all
0.5	0.4	of
0.9	0.9	you.
0.2	0.6	And
0.2	0.7	I
0.8	0.7	don't
0.5	0.3	understand
0.5	0.4	for
0.8	0.6	the
0.9	0.4	life
0.7	0.9	of
0.3	0.5	me
0.9	0.3	the
0.3	0.5	line
0.7	0.5	of
0.6	0.7	questioning
0.2	0.8	about
0.8	0.1	electioneering
0.7	0.7	taking
0.1	0.2	place
0.2	0.8	by
0.5	0.2	some
0.7	0.3	of
0.8	0.9	your
0.8	0.3	companies.
0.3	0.3	If
0.1	0.7	you're
0.1	0.3	opposed
0.8	0.7	to
0.7	0.6	electioneering
0.9	0.8	by
0.6	0.1	corporations,
0.8	0.9	as
1	0.8	I
0.6	0.1	am,
0.3	0	and
0.5	0.1	you're
0.3	0.6	opposed
0.2	0.6	to
0.7	0.3	Citizens
0.2	0.1	United,
1	0.6	then
0.1	1	you've
0.4	0.4	got
0.7	0.8	no
0.2	0	problem.

0.6	0.6	It

0.3	0.1	on
0.3	0.6	your

0.8	0.9	It
0.9	0.8	sounds
0.9	0.8	a
0.1	0.6	bit
0.3	0.9	like
0.5	0.7	a
0.4	0.8	stock
0.1	0.2	market

0.8	0.6	unlike
0.2	0.6	a

0.6	0	there's

0.9	1	actually
0.5	0.4	prohibit
0.7	0.6	insider
0	1	trading,
0.4	0.2	which
0.8	0.3	means
0.6	0.6	that

0.7	0.9	Instead,

0.3	0.1	the

0.7	0.7	Does

0.8	0.9	PICHAI:
0.1	1	Congresswoman,
0.7	0.3	if
0.9	0.2	I
0	0.8	could
0.2	0.6	explain
0.7	0.1	this
0.9	0.9	for
0.1	0.3	a
0.6	0.8	minute,
0.8	0.6	we
1	0.2	paid
0.7	0.6	over
0.2	0.1	$14
0.8	0.7	billion
0.2	0.1	to
0.6	1	publishers.
0.9	0	We
0.2	0.6	are
0.7	0.5	deeply
0.3	0.6	committed
0.8	0.4	to
0.2	0.1	journalism.
0.1	0.5	In
0.6	0.1	this
0.5	0.3	area,
0.2	0.7	on
0.7	0.5	a--on
0.7	0.7	an
0.4	0.8	average,
0.6	0.6	we
0.1	0.3	pay
0.2	0.1	out
0.4	0.3	69
0.1	0.5	percent
0.9	0.5	of
0.5	0.8	the
0.7	0	revenue
0.1	1	when
0.5	0.8	publishers
1	0.1	use
0.6	0.4	Google's
0	0.2	buy
0.4	0.8	and
0.8	1	sell
0.4	0.7	side
0.5	0.9	tools.
0.3	0.2	And,
0.1	0.5	you
0.4	0.8	know,
1	0.1	out
0.1	0.5	of--it's
0.6	0.4	a
0.1	0.1	low
0.7	0.5	margin
0.2	0.3	business
0.5	0.4	for
0.8	0.6	us.
0.9	0.8	We
0.8	0.4	do
0.6	0.4	it
0.6	0.5	because
0.7	0.2	we
0.1	0.3	want
0.6	0	to
0.4	0.1	help
0.9	0.1	support

0.7	0.3	--Right--
0.1	0.3	
0.6	0.2	
0.9	0.5	PICHAI:
0.5	0.3	--In
0.3	0	this

0.6	0.8	
0	0.2	
0.5	0.2	JAYAPAL:
0.5	0.6	No,
0.4	0.5	I--I
0.2	0	understand
0.5	0.1	that,
0.1	0.1	Mr.
0.4	0.9	Pichai.
0.2	0.5	What
0.1	0.2	I'm
0.3	0.1	trying
0.6	0.3	to
0.2	0.8	get
0.4	0.3	at
0.9	0.6	is,
0.6	0.9	when
0.6	0.1	any
0.7	0.3	company
0.6	0.6	controls
0	0.3	buy
0.3	0.5	and
0.3	0.7	the
0.2	0.6	sell
0.8	0.4	side--I
0.3	0.9	worked
1	0.8	on
0.8	0.1	Wall
0.1	0.6	Street
0.1	0.9	a
0.5	0.9	very
0.8	0.3	long
0.9	0.2	time
0.7	0.2	ago--there
0.3	0.7	are
0.7	0.2	reasons
0.8	0.5	that
0.3	0.1	insider
0.1	0.2	trading
0.3	0.7	is
0.6	0.3	regulated.
0.4	0.5	And
0.8	0.5	this
0.7	0.2	ad
0.3	0.1	exchange
0.5	0.2	is
0.7	0.4	essentially
0.5	1	the
0.7	0.6	same
0.9	0.5	thing.
0.8	0.3	And
0.1	0.3	without
0.5	0.5	accountability,
0.4	0.5	it
0.8	0.8	isn't
0.3	0.7	meaningful
0.7	0.7	to
0.3	0.2	just
0.8	0.4	care
0.6	0.1	about
1	0.5	the
0.6	0	newspapers.
0.2	0.5	We're
1	0.8	seeing
0.5	0.8	them
0.5	0.6	die
0.7	0.3	all
0.2	0.7	over
0.1	0.4	and
0.5	0.5	ad
1	0.8	revenue
0.5	0.8	is
0.5	0.1	a
0.6	0.6	big
0.5	0.7	reason.
0.6	0.7	Let
1	0.8	me
0.2	0.1	put
0.3	0	up
0.3	0.5	a
0.1	0	graph
0.4	1	here
0.6	0.5	that
1	0.9	shows
0.4	0.7	that
0.9	0.1	Google's
0.7	0.4	ad
0.3	0.1	revenue
0.2	0.4	is
0.8	0.8	increasingly
0.9	0	coming
0.8	0.2	from
0.4	0.2	ads
1	1	on
1	0.3	Google
0.9	0.2	owned
0.8	0.9	sites
0.6	0.3	and
0.1	0.3	less
0.6	0.6	so
0.9	0.2	from
0.5	0.3	other
0.2	0	websites.
0.6	0	Can
0.3	0	you
0.8	0.9	explain
0.7	0.5	that
0.7	0.9	trend?
0.9	0.2	
0.9	0.8	
0.9	0.3	PICHAI:
0.7	0.7	I
0.5	0.7	can't
0.2	0.9	quite
0.9	0.6	see
0.5	0.9	whether
0.5	0.4	this
0.5	1	is
0.6	0.6	net
0.3	0.8	revenue
0	0.3	or
0.6	0.1	gross
0.3	0.7	revenue.
0.9	0.7	Obviously,
0.6	0.7	when
0.9	0.8	it
0.6	0.3	comes
0.8	0.4	to
0.3	0.5	non-Google
1	0.6	properties,
0.3	0.7	we
0.6	0.3	share
0.6	0.9	the
0.1	0.2	majority
0.1	0.7	of
0.9	0.1	revenue
0.9	0.3	back
0.1	0.6	to
0.2	0.1	publishers,
0.6	0.1	whereas
0.3	0.9	on
0.2	0.4	our
0.7	0.7	own
0.7	0.1	properties
0.8	0.5	we
0.5	0.1	obviously--you
0.9	0.3	know,
0	0.1	we
0.3	0.3	are--we
0.2	0.6	have
0.1	0.8	the
0	0.7	inventory.
0.7	0.9	So--but
0.5	0.3	I
0.9	0.8	would
0.9	0.6	need
0.4	0.6	to
0.6	0.9	understand
0.9	0.7	more.
0.1	0.4	I
0.8	0.1	just
0.9	0.4	quickly
0.9	0.4	looked
0.6	0.1	at
0.5	0.3	it.
0.6	0.7	
0.8	0	
0.2	0.3	JAYAPAL:
0.7	0.7	Okay.
0.5	0.8	
0	0.9	
0.3	0.7	PICHAI:
0	0.8	I--and
0.9	0.1	I
0.3	0.1	am
0.7	0.8	not
0.4	0.2	sure
0.2	0.9	I
0.4	0.4	fully
0.1	0.5	grasped
0.8	0.2	it.
0.3	0.4	
0.3	0.3	
1	0.1	JAYAPAL:
0.5	0.7	We--we
0.3	0.8	can
0.9	0.4	send
0.9	1	it.
0.4	0.9	We
0.1	0.8	can
0.7	0.8	send
0.9	0.4	it
0.5	0.1	to
0.6	0.9	you
0.6	0	and
0.4	0.8	make
0.8	0.5	sure
0.6	0.1	you
0.2	1	have
0.9	0.8	it.
0.6	0.9	You
0.8	0.1	know,
0.8	0.6	Google
0	0.3	has
0.6	0.3	not
0.2	0.8	made
0.9	0.5	it
0.8	0.7	search
0.5	0.8	traffic
0.8	0.2	volumes
0.3	0.3	public
0.8	0.4	in
0.6	0.8	years,
0.6	0.8	so
0.7	0.3	there's
0.7	0.1	no
0.7	0.1	way
0.4	0.8	for
0.6	0.6	us
0	0.4	to
0.1	0.3	know
0.1	0.2	exactly
0.5	0.8	what's
0.2	0.3	happening
0.5	1	here.
0.2	0.6	And
0.8	0.4	there's
0.5	0.9	no
0.8	0.9	way
0	0.3	for
0.3	0.3	businesses
0.3	0.4	to
0.4	0.7	verify
0.5	0.2	whether
0.8	0.4	they've
0.5	0.9	been
0.7	0.1	treated
0.9	1	fairly
0.3	0.7	or
0.2	0.3	left
0	0.4	behind
0.8	0.9	in
0.2	0.6	favor
0.5	0.5	of
1	0.7	Google
0.2	0.7	owned
0.6	0.2	companies.
0.4	0.1	Is
0.7	0.8	Google
0.4	0.1	steering
0.7	0.3	advertising
0.1	0.5	revenue
0.8	0	to
0.1	0.4	Google
0.7	1	search?
0.2	0.1	
0.2	0.1	
0.3	0.7	PICHAI:
0.6	0.4	Congressman,
0.3	0.1	users
0.9	0.3	come
0.2	0.3	to
0.2	0.9	Google
0.1	0.2	search.
0.4	0.1	It
0.4	0.3	is
0.9	1	that
0.4	0.1	traffic
0.1	0.9	and,
0.3	0.3	you
0.7	0.3	know,
0.5	0.1	that's
0.5	0.7	where
0.6	0.6	our
0.9	0.7	source
0.7	0.7	of
0.7	0.1	revenue
1	0.1	comes
0.3	0.1	from.
0.4	0.5	So,
0.3	0.5	we're
0.3	0.1	focused
0.6	0.7	on
0.4	0.2	providing
0.3	0.5	users
0.1	0	the
0.2	0.8	information
0.4	0.6	they
0.6	0.8	are
0.3	0.8	looking
0	0.7	for.
0.1	0	We
0.7	0.8	work
0.7	0.9	hard
0.5	0.1	to
0	0.9	earn
0.4	0.1	their
0.3	0.9	trust.
0.6	0.7	We
0.9	0.1	know
0.3	0.5	competition
0.7	0	for
0.6	0.5	information
0.9	0.2	is
0.7	0.6	just
0.5	0.8	a
0.7	0.6	click
0.6	0.6	away.
0.6	1	
0.6	0.6	
0.1	0.3	JAYAPAL:
0.7	0.7	Thank
0.3	0.7	you.
0.8	0.7	Thank
0.2	0.7	you,
0.8	0.8	Mr.
0.8	0.6	Pichai.
0.9	0.4	I
0.7	0.2	just
0.1	0.1	want
0.1	0.8	to
0.5	1	make
0.9	0.7	the
0.6	0.7	point
1	0.9	that
0.7	0.2	independent
0.9	0.6	journalism
0.9	0.4	is
0.7	0.5	incredibly
0	0.1	necessary
0.4	0.7	to
0.5	0	our
0.6	1	democracy,
0.5	0	and
0.9	0.1	we
0.2	0.7	want
0.4	0.6	to
0.1	0.6	do
0.1	0.5	what
0.4	0.1	we
0.2	0.4	can
0.4	0.5	to
0.3	0	protect
0.7	0	it.
0.8	0.6	I--I
0.5	0.7	want
1	0.5	to
0.4	1	just
0.8	0.5	ask
1	0.8	one
0.4	0.2	last
0.6	0.8	question
0.4	0.2	of
0.2	0.4	Mr.
0	0.7	Zuckerberg.
0.8	0.5	Over
0.6	0.8	1,100
0.4	1	companies
0.6	0.6	and
0	0.8	organizations
0.6	0.8	pull
0.9	0.1	their
0.7	0.8	advertising
0.4	1	business
0.2	0.4	from
0.8	1	Facebook
0.2	0.9	as
0.7	1	part
0.3	0.5	of
0.9	0.8	the
0.4	0.3	stop
0.1	0.6	hate
0.9	0.9	for
0.9	0.1	profit
0.9	0.7	campaign
0.4	0.3	to
0.1	0.4	protest
0.3	0.2	the
0.6	0.6	spread
0.8	0.5	of
0.2	0.3	hate
0.1	0.5	speech
0	0.7	and
0.9	0.7	disinformation.
0.7	0.6	But
0.6	0.4	you
0.6	0.7	had
0.1	0.8	a
0.1	0.1	staff
0.6	0.1	meeting
0	0.9	earlier
0.5	0.9	this
0.3	0.1	month
0.9	0.6	where
0.4	0.8	you
0.4	0.8	told
0.5	0.9	employees
0.5	0.1	we're
0.5	0.4	not
0.7	0.7	going
0.1	0.5	to
0.2	0.6	change
0.8	0.7	our
0.8	0.8	policies
0.4	0.5	or
0.8	1	approach
0.4	0.3	because
0.1	0.1	of
0.4	0.8	the
0.6	0.4	threat
1	0.3	to
0.2	0.4	any
0	0.1	percent
0.7	0.1	of
0.3	0.2	our
0.9	0.7	revenue.
0.6	0.2	My
0.5	0.3	guess
0.1	0.2	is
0.4	0.2	all
0.9	0.6	these
0.7	0.1	advertisers
0.1	0.8	will
0.2	0.4	be
0.4	0	back
0.5	0.4	on
0.3	0.2	the
0.5	0.2	platform
0.9	0.4	soon
0.5	0.6	enough.
0.1	0.3	Mr.
0.5	1	Zuckerberg,
0.5	0.4	are
0.5	0.6	you
0.8	0.9	so
0.7	0.7	big
0.1	0.3	that
0.7	0.7	you
0.1	0.1	don't
0.2	0.4	care
1	0.6	how
0.7	0.6	you're
0.3	0.1	impacted
0.4	0.8	by
0.5	0.1	a
0.3	0.5	major
0.3	0.1	boycott
0.2	0.7	of
0.8	0.6	1,100
0.5	0.5	advertisers?
0.7	0.8	
0.5	0.3	
0	0.1	ZUCKERBERG:
0.5	0.6	No,
0.4	0.1	Congresswoman,
0.5	1	of--of
0.8	0	course
0.8	0.4	we
0.7	0.5	care.
0.7	1	But
0.6	0.4	we're
0	0	also
0.1	0.5	not
0.4	0.3	going
0.7	0.3	to
0.9	0.5	set
0.2	0.7	our
0.5	0.7	content
1	0.9	policies
0	0.5	because
0.7	0.7	of
0.8	0.5	advertisers.
0.5	0.7	I
1	0.1	think
0.1	0.5	that
0.1	0.1	that
0.7	0.7	would

0.8	1	thing
0.6	0.3	for

1	0.2	to
0.7	0.2	do.
0.5	0.1	We've
0.6	1	cared
0.7	1	about
0.3	0.1	issues
0.9	0.8	like
0.1	0.7	fighting
0.4	0.1	hate
0.9	0.4	speech
0.5	0.2	for
0.2	0.3	a
0.5	0.7	long
0.7	0.8	time,
0.6	0.8	and
0.7	0.7	we've
0.9	0.3	invested
0.1	0.4	billions
0.5	0.7	of
0.8	0.5	dollars.
0.7	0.8	And
0.9	0.3	I've
0.3	0.5	talked
0.9	0.7	about
0.3	0.7	today
0.5	0.3	how
0.2	0.3	we
0.5	0.6	have
0.2	0.5	tens
0.8	0.9	of
0.6	0.1	thousands
0.5	0.5	of
0.5	0.4	content
0.5	0.3	reviewers.
0.1	0.2	We've
0.4	0.6	built
1	1	AI
0.1	0.4	systems
0.8	0.7	that
0.5	0.2	proactively
0.7	0.1	identify
0.2	0.7	the
0.8	0	majority.
0	0.7	We're
0.9	0.6	now
0.4	0.9	at
0.5	0.7	89
0.9	0.4	percent
0.8	0.2	of
0.6	0.7	the
0.3	0.6	hate
0.5	0.3	speech
0	0.6	that
0.6	0.8	we
0.5	0.5	remove
0.8	0.5	before
0.4	0.4	anyone
0.3	0.8	even
0.2	0	reports
0.9	0.8	it
0.6	0.2	to
0.5	0.6	us.
0.4	0.5	We're
0.4	0.3	going
0.9	0.2	to
0.8	0.1	continue
0.3	0.8	getting
0.2	0.5	better
0.7	1	at
0.4	0.6	that.
0.1	0.4	And
0.9	0.6	I
0.8	0.1	think
0.3	0.5	that
0	0.2	those
0.2	0.1	investments
0	0.7	over
0.8	0.6	time
0.8	0.7	and
0.9	0.5	the
0.1	0.2	results
0.9	0.6	that
0.2	0.2	we've
0.4	0.2	put
0.9	0.8	up
0.2	0.4	will
0.7	0.3	be
0.6	0.8	recognized
0.5	0.5	by
0.6	0.6	people,
0.2	0.8	since
0.4	0.3	I
0	0.8	do

1	0.4	that
0.6	0.1	they
0.7	0.8	are
0.4	0.3	industry-leading.
0.3	0.4	And
0.2	0.8	I--I
0.7	0.4	think
0.9	0.2	that
0.9	0.1	our
0	0.1	advertising
0.1	0.7	also
0.7	0.8	is,
0.1	0.6	for
0.1	0.8	a
0.5	0.5	lot
0.6	0.6	of
0.7	0.2	small
0.1	0	businesses,
0.4	0.4	the

0.2	0.3	effective
0.2	0.7	or
0.9	0.5	among
0.7	0.5	the

0	0.5	ways
0.8	0.6	that
0.3	0	they

0.8	0.5	My

0.1	0.4	but
0.1	0	I

0.2	0.9	I
0.3	0.1	don't
0.2	0.9	think
0.5	0.1	that
0.8	0.9	you've
0.5	0.8	implemented
0.1	0.8	all
0.1	0.5	those
0.9	0.9	recommendations
0.7	0.1	yet.
0.1	0.5	I

0.1	0.9	This
0.5	0.1	is
0.1	0.1	a
0.7	0.3	critical
0	1	time,
0.6	0.9	as

0.2	0.5	There

0.6	0.3	in

0.1	0.5	we

0.1	0.8	I

0.2	0.6	In
0.7	0	March
0	0.1	2020,
1	0.9	Amazon
0.6	0.4	announced
0.1	0.1	that
0	1	it
0.1	0.5	was
0.6	0.8	going
1	0.5	to
0.2	0.5	are
0.2	0.2	delaying
0.6	0.9	shipments
0.3	1	of
0.2	0.9	nonessential
0.6	0.8	products
0	0.7	in
0.8	0.1	order
0.4	0.6	to
0	0.5	better
0.4	0.9	serve
0.4	0.9	customers
0.1	0.7	and
0.5	0.2	meet
0.5	1	need
0.6	0.9	while
0.3	0.6	helping
0.3	0.7	to
0.3	0.1	ensure
0.8	0.8	the
0.2	0.1	safety
0.6	1	of
0.9	0.6	their
0.1	0.1	warehouse
0.2	0.8	workers.
1	0.4	In
0.8	0.7	practice,
0.5	0.6	however,
0.3	0.1	it
0.6	0.8	appears
0.2	1	that
0	0.6	this
0.9	0.6	policy
0.3	0.1	was
0.7	1	applied
0.1	0.9	selectively,
0.5	0.7	as
0.3	0.2	Amazon
0.3	0.1	appeared
0.1	0.9	to
0.9	0.4	continue
0.2	0.3	to
0.5	0.3	designate
0.2	0.6	its
0.3	0.3	own
0.3	0.7	products
0.2	0.4	as
0.8	0.3	essential
0.5	1	even
0	0.8	as
0.7	1	it
0.4	0.7	delayed
0.6	0.1	competing
0.9	0.4	products
0.9	0.5	from
0.6	0.6	third-party
0.5	0.3	sellers.
0.1	0.2	So,
0.5	0.8	the
0.1	0.3	essential
0.2	0.9	items
0.7	0.8	were
0.5	0.7	supposed
0.6	0.2	to
0.5	0.4	include
0.6	0	household
0.6	0.7	staples,
0.3	0.2	medical
1	0.8	supplies,
0.5	1	high
0.6	0.7	demand
0.9	0.7	products,
0.1	0.8	and
0	0.9	that
0.8	0.3	many
0.6	0.9	factors
0.7	0.9	were
0.2	0.6	considered
0.8	0.9	when
0.8	0.1	determining
0	0.4	eligibility
0.9	0.8	to
0.4	0.1	be
0.7	1	essential.
0.1	0.7	But
0.7	0.7	we've
0.3	0.8	had
0.7	0.2	several
0.5	0.3	employees
0.2	0	report
0.9	0.9	that
0	0	Amazon
0.6	0.4	continued

0.5	0.9	ship
0.8	0.8	nonessential
0.4	0.4	items
0.1	0	like

0.5	0.3	pool
0.5	0.2	floaties,
0.3	0.1	etc.
0.9	0.3	Mr.

0.9	0.9	were
0.9	0.8	Amazon
0.8	0.8	devices
1	0.4	like

0.1	0.5	during

0.1	1

0.3	0.2	BEZOS:

0.1	0.7	What
0.6	0.7	I
0	0.1	can
0.9	0.8	tell
0.7	0.3	you
0.3	0.1	is
0.8	0.7	that
0.6	0.1	we

0.4	0.6	It

0.8	0.7	We

0.9	0.4	But
0.3	0.2	at
1	0.8	any
0.8	0.5	rate,
0.6	0.9	moving
0.8	0.8	along,
0.6	0.1	we--with

0.1	0.7	about
0.5	0.4	the
0.6	0.8	fees
0.7	0.5	that
0.5	0.8	Amazon
0.1	1	charges
0.8	0	sellers.
0.1	0.3	According
0.8	0.7	to
0.9	0.3	a
0.7	0.4	recent
0.7	0.1	report,
0.8	0.6	seller
0.6	0.4	fees
0.7	0.1	net
0.6	0.6	Amazon
0.6	0.5	almost
0.1	0.6	$60
0	0.3	billion
0.6	0.3	in
0.9	0.6	2019,
0.8	0	nearly
0.4	0.1	double
0.6	0.9	the
0.8	0.7	$35
0	0.9	billion
0.6	0.8	in
0.6	0.9	revenue
1	0	from
0.7	0.1	AWS,
0.7	0.7	Amazon's
0.1	1	massive
0.5	0.5	cloud-computing
1	0.8	division.
1	0.7	Five
0.3	1	years
0.4	0.3	ago,
0.8	1	Amazon
0.9	0	took
0.2	0.5	an
0.9	0.7	average
0.6	0.7	of
0.8	0.9	19
0	0.9	percent
0.2	0.6	of

0.1	0.5	a
0.4	0	third-party
0.6	0.1	on
0.4	0.3	its
0.7	0.7	site.
0.1	0.6	Today,
0.4	0.7	Amazon
0.5	0.9	keeps
0.8	0.2	an
0.9	0.1	average
0.5	0	of
0.4	0.9	30
0.8	0.8	percent.
0.1	0.7	Doesn't
0.5	0.7	Amazon's
0.3	0.3	ability
0.7	0.1	to
0.4	0.1	hike
0.9	0.3	those
0.4	0.3	fees
0.1	0.7	so
0.2	0.9	steeply
0.2	0.8	suggest
0.8	0.6	that
0.7	0.7	Amazon
0.9	0.5	enjoys
0.9	0.6	market
0.5	0.5	power
0.3	0.6	over
0.9	0.4	those
0.5	0.8	sellers?
0.5	0.1	
0.2	0.2	
0.9	0.4	BEZOS:
0.8	0.3	No,
0.8	0.8	congresswoman,
0.9	0.3	I
0.3	0.6	don't
0.8	0.4	believe
0.4	0.6	so.
0.1	0	I
0.4	0.2	think
0.9	0.7	what
0.6	0.2	you're
0.5	0.9	seeing
0.7	0.8	there
0.9	0	when
0.7	1	you
0.5	0.3	see
0.8	0.1	that
0.8	0.5	go
0.1	0.1	from
0.9	0.1	19
0.6	0.8	percent
0.3	1	to
0.8	0.3	30
0.7	0.1	percent
0.3	0.6	is
0.4	0.9	that
0.7	0.6	more
0.5	0.9	and
1	0.7	more
0.1	0.7	sellers
0.8	0.2	are
0.3	1	taking
0.7	0.7	advantage
0.8	0.3	of
0	0.1	the
0.9	0.7	incremental
0.4	0.2	services
0.8	0	that
0.6	0.7	we
0.5	0.8	offer.
0.4	0.4	And
0.6	0.6	a
0.7	0.8	big
0.2	0.8	piece
0.1	0.1	of
0.3	0.3	that
0.3	0.9	is
0.3	0.7	fulfillment
0.6	0.8	by
0.8	0.2	Amazon,
0.5	0.5	which
0.6	0.3	is
0.4	0.4	probably
0.6	0.7	the
0.6	0.5	greatest
0.6	0.3	innovation
0.3	0.7	that
0.3	0.7	we
0.4	0.8	ever
0.2	0.4	created
0.7	0	for
0.1	0.6	sellers.
0.7	0.1	And
0.4	0.3	it's
0.7	0.6	working
0.3	0.3	for
0.9	0	sellers.
0.1	0.7	That's
0.7	0.9	why
1	0.7	today
0.8	0.2	60
0.5	0.4	percent
0.9	0.7	of
0.3	0.5	sales
0.3	0.4	are
0.7	0.7	going
0.6	0.5	to
0.9	0.8	third-party
0.8	0.4	sellers,
0.8	0.8	up
0.8	0.6	from
0.1	1	zero
0.3	0.4	20
0.3	0.6	years
0.3	0.1	ago.
0.2	0	
0.4	0.9	
1	0	SCANLON:
0.9	0.8	Right.
0.9	0.3	But
0.4	0.9	I--I
0.9	0.3	think
0.5	0.3	a
0.2	0.4	little
0.7	0.7	more
0.5	0.1	concerning
0.1	0.2	is
0.1	0.4	the
0.1	0.2	11
0.6	0.5	percent
0.4	0.7	hike.
0.2	0.6	Since
0.2	0.9	2014,
0.5	0.2	Amazon's
0.1	0.2	revenue
0.5	0.8	from
0.6	0.8	seller
0.1	0.7	fees
0.7	0.8	as
0.5	0.6	grown
0.4	0.5	almost
0.9	0.8	twice
0.7	0.1	as
0.7	0.4	fast
0.1	0.2	as
0.2	0.5	its
0.8	0	overall
0.7	0.4	sales.
0.9	0.8	So,
0.7	0.3	seller
0.7	0.5	fees
0.2	0.6	now
0.6	0	account
0.7	0.7	for
0.3	0.5	21
0	0.4	percent
0.4	0.3	of
0.9	0.9	Amazon's
0.4	1	total
0.7	0.6	revenue.
0.4	0.3	Mr.

0.4	0.3	aren't
0.9	0.8	seller
0.6	0.1	fees

0.4	0.4	effectively
0.3	0.2	subsidizing

0.5	0.3	
0.8	0.2	
0.3	0.1	BEZOS:
0.2	0.4	Congressman,
0.1	0.3	no,
0	0.7	I
0.5	0.3	don't
0.7	0.2	believe
0.2	0.3	so.
0.4	0.5	I
0.1	0.4	think
0.1	0.4	what
0.8	0.2	you're
0.2	0.9	seeing
0.8	0.1	there,
0.1	0.8	when
0.3	0.5	you
0.4	0.2	see
0.7	0.2	these
0.2	0.4	fees
0.2	1	going
0.2	0.9	up,
0.9	0.8	it--what's
0.3	0.2	really
1	0.5	happening
0.8	0.4	is
0.1	0.8	that
0.7	0.6	sellers
0.9	0.8	are
0.4	0.3	choosing
0.8	0.2	to
0.6	0.7	use
0.7	0.8	more
0.6	0.8	of
0.5	0.3	our
0.1	0.9	services
0.9	0	that
0.6	0.3	we
0.9	0.4	make
0.2	0.1	available.
0.3	0.4	They
0.7	0.4	are--you
0.8	0.5	know,
0	0.8	previously
0.9	0.4	perhaps
0.6	0.1	they
0.6	0.3	were
0.4	0.3	shipping

0.3	0.1	their

0.7	0.8	got
0.1	0.6	fulfillment
0.8	0.8	by

0.6	0.7	And
0.2	0.8	a
0.1	0.1	year
0	0.8	ago
0.6	0.6	we
0.2	0.2	asked
0.1	0.3	whether

0.8	0.5	enrolled
0.3	0.7	in

0	0.1	is
0.8	0.1	a

0.5	0.2	they
0.7	0.7	can

0.2	0.6	the

0.2	0.9	said
0.4	0.8	no.
0.7	0.1	But
0.6	0.1	the
0.3	0.1	evidence

0.9	0.4	in
0.8	0.8	that
0.4	0.6	program
0.2	0.2	is
0.5	0.2	a
0.8	0.3	major
0.3	0.2	factor
0.2	0.6	ended
0.3	0.8	up
0.1	0.8	first
0.1	0.8	effectively
0.5	0.3	forces
0.2	0.7	sellers
0.6	0.4	to

0.6	0.8	for
1	0.7	fulfillment
0.4	0.3	services
0.1	0.1	from

0.8	0.7	Mr.

0.6	0.8	Amazon's
0.6	0.5	big
0.6	0.2	Buy
0.3	0.1	Box
1	0.2	algorithm
0.4	0.3	ever

0.1	1	from

0.8	0.5	over
0.7	0.9	other
0.3	0.3	sellers?
0.6	0.7	
1	0.9	
0.2	0.6	BEZOS:
0.8	0.2	I
0.6	0.3	think
0.7	0.9	effectively
0.8	0.9	the
0.5	0.9	Buy
0.7	0.7	Box--maybe
1	1	directly
0.3	0.6	or
0.6	0.3	indirectly,
0.5	1	I'm
0.1	1	not
0	0.6	sure
0.5	0.9	if
0.6	0.1	it's
0.4	0.7	direct,
0.6	1	but
0.8	0	indirectly,
0.3	0.1	I
0.1	0.4	think
0.4	0.8	the
0.5	0.2	Buy
0.4	0.4	Box
0.6	0.5	does
0.3	0.8	favor
0.1	0.1	products
0.9	0.9	that

0.6	0.3	be
0.5	0.3	shipped
0.9	0.5	with

0.7	0.5	So
0.3	0.8	especially
0.1	0.2	if
0.1	0.6	you
0.2	0.8	are
0.9	0.1	a
0.8	0.7	Prime
0.5	0.4	member,
0.7	0.1	the
0.3	0.1	Buy
0.3	0.5	Box
0.9	0.5	is
0.9	0.7	trying
0.3	0.8	to
0.1	0.4	pick
0.1	0.3	the
0.6	0.3	offer,
0.1	0.6	if
0.9	0.8	we
0	0.5	have
0.8	0.7	multiple
0.4	0.4	offers
0.8	0.7	from
0.3	0.1	multiple
0.5	0.3	sellers
0.2	0	for
1	0	the
0.2	0.1	same
0.6	0.4	item,
0	0	customer
0.1	0.3	wants
0.3	1	to
0.8	0.7	buy
0	0.1	that
0.1	0.3	item,
0.4	0.1	the
1	0.6	Buy
0.8	0.4	Box
0	0.5	is
0.4	0.3	trying
0.1	0.7	to
0.1	0.8	pick
0.9	0.9	the
0.2	0.7	offer
0.6	0.4	that
0.3	1	we
0.5	0.5	predicted
0.1	0.6	the
0.4	1	customer
1	0.8	would
0.3	0.7	most
0.3	0.4	like.
0.7	0.3	That
0.7	0.8	includes
0.8	0.4	price,
0.3	0.5	it
0.5	0.2	includes
0.9	0	delivery
0.9	0.8	speed.
0.1	0.5	And
0.4	0.4	if
0.6	0.9	you're
0.3	0.8	a
0.5	0.5	Prime
0.6	0	member,
0.5	1	it
0	0	includes
0.6	0.8	whether
0.7	0.9	the
0.4	0.3	item
0.1	0.3	is
0.6	0.1	eligible
0.2	0.3	for
0.3	0.5	Prime.
0.1	0.9	And
0.8	0.8	so
1	0.1	I
0.9	0.6	think--
0.2	1	
0	0.9	
0.1	0.3	SCANLON:
0.6	0.9	--Thank
0.3	0.4	you,
1	0.2	Mr.

0.2	0.7

0.6	0.4	Before

0.9	0.4	two
0.7	0.3	colleagues,
0.1	0.4	I
0.4	0.9	think
0.8	0.8	Mr.

0.6	0	like
0.6	0.3	to
1	0.5	clarify

0.4	0.8	question
0.3	0.6	before

0.4	0.6	I
0.2	0.3	wasn't

0.5	0.2

0.1	0.9	I

0.2	0.3	I
0.1	0.2	believe
0.1	0.8	that's
0.6	0	the

0.9	0.9	because
0.1	0.9	we

0.7	0.6	and
0.7	0.3	they--they--precisely,
0.6	0.8	they
0.9	0.9	say
0.3	0	that
1	0.6	app
0.5	0.3	developers
1	0.5	should

0.3	0.3	so

0.7	0.8	My

0.6	0.7	You

0.8	0.4	a

0.3	0.9	clear
0.2	0.2	privacy

0.4	0.6	It

0.3	0.6	It

0.7	0.8	do

0.8	0.9	
0.3	0.1	ZUCKERBERG:
0.4	0.2	Congresswoman,
0.9	0.1	I
0.2	0.9	am

0.7	0.6	We

0.5	0.8	ZUCKERBERG:

0.5	0.6	
0.9	0.7	
0.2	0.5	ZUCKERBERG:

0.2	0.7	
0.7	0.7	
0.2	0.8	MCBATH:
0.3	0.1	Okay.
0.5	0.3	So,
0.7	0.2	Mr.
0.4	0.9	Zuckerberg,
0.9	0.7	the
0.1	0.4	bottom
0.6	0.7	line
0.2	0.9	here
0.7	0.2	is
0.2	0.5	that
1	0.3	you
0.3	0.5	broke
0.2	0.8	a
1	0.3	commitment
0	0.3	to
0.3	0.4	your
0.7	0.6	users
0.6	0.3	and
0.6	0.5	who
0.1	0.6	can
0.1	0.1	say
0.2	0.3	if
0.1	0.5	you
0.7	0.1	may
1	0.1	or
0.9	0.4	may
0.9	0.3	not
0.3	1	do
0.5	0.3	that
0.6	0.6	again
0.4	0.3	in
0	0.3	the
0.5	0.2	future.
1	0.5	The
0.9	0.9	reality
0.5	0.1	is
0.9	0	that
0.7	0.4	Facebook's
0.6	0.4	market
0.7	0.9	power
0.7	0.8	grew,
0.2	0.8	and
0.9	0.4	Facebook
0.1	0.1	sacrificed
0.8	0.3	its
0.1	0.7	users
0.4	0.9	policy.
0.9	0.1	Mr.
0.6	0.2	baize
0.6	0.3	owes
0.3	0.8	my
0.5	0.5	colleagues
0.2	0.9	have
0.1	0.4	touched
0.1	0.1	on
1	0.7	counterfeit
0.3	0.2	goods,
0.1	0.4	and
0.5	0.8	I
0.9	0.2	share
0	0.7	their
0.7	0.6	concerns
0	0	very
0.7	0.7	deeply.
0.6	0.8	I
0.3	0.6	am
0.7	0.9	also
0.9	0.6	concerned
0.5	0.3	about
0.3	0.1	stolen
0.9	1	goods.
0.1	0.6	Mr.
0.2	0.9	Bezos
0.2	0.7	are
0.8	0.5	stolen
0.3	0.1	goods
0.8	0.7	sold
1	0.2	on
0.2	0.8	Amazon?
0.5	0.1	
0.5	0.2	
0.7	0.6	BEZOS:
0.5	0.4	Congresswoman
0.6	1	not
0.1	0.3	to
0.7	0.6	my
0.8	0.3	knowledge
0.9	0.6	although
0.7	0.1	there
0.6	0.9	are
0.3	0.9	more
0.9	0	than
0.1	0.8	1
0.3	0.3	million
0.8	0.4	sellers
0.6	0.4	and
0.7	0.7	so
0.3	0.9	I
0.8	0.7	am
0.8	0.3	sure
0.8	0.9	that
0.9	0	there
0.3	0.5	have
0.4	0.1	been
0.1	0.4	stolen
0.8	0.6	goods--
0.4	1	
0.2	0.7	
0.3	0.8	MCBATH:
1	0.8	Really,
0.6	0.3	Mr.
0.7	0.3	Bezos?
0.8	1	
0	1	
0.1	1	BEZOS:
0.6	0.8	On
0	0.6	Amazon.
0.7	0.6	
0.1	0.2	
0.4	0	MCBATH:
0.6	0.6	Really,
0.1	0.8	Mr.
0.7	0.2	Bezos?
0.3	0.8	
0.9	0.3	
0.3	0.2	BEZOS:
0.3	0.9	I'm
0.3	0	sorry?
0.2	0.5	
0.4	0.1	
0.1	0.5	MCBATH:
0.8	0.9	They're
0.3	1	not?
0.6	0.5	You
0.4	0.6	don't
0	0.9	believe
0	0.9	that
0.2	0.8	there
0.7	0.8	is,
0.7	0.8	that
0.8	0.8	surprises
0	1	me.
0.8	0.7	
0.3	0.9	
0.2	1	BEZOS:
0.1	0.8	No,
0.2	0.2	just
0.3	0.4	with
0.2	1	over
0.7	0.9	1
0.9	0.5	million
0.8	0.3	sellers,
0.7	0.8	I
0.9	0.8	am
0.4	0.8	sure
0.8	0.9	that
1	0.4	it
0.3	0.3	has
0.2	0.7	happened,
0.6	0.6	but
0.6	0.9	certainly,
0.1	0.3	I
0.9	0.4	don't
0.6	0.5	think
0.4	0.6	it
0.1	0.1	is
0.6	0	a
0.5	0.3	large
0.3	0.2	part
0.1	0.2	of
0	0.5	what
0.1	0	we
0	0.2	are
0.8	0.8	selling.
0.5	1	
0	0.5	
0.7	0.9	MCBATH:
0.3	0.3	Okay,
0.8	0.7	so
0.5	0.1	Mr.
0.2	0.6	Bezos,
0.9	0.8	basically,
0.1	0.5	then
0.4	0.5	you
0.9	0.4	are
0.9	0	saying
0.7	0.2	yes?
0.7	0.1	
0.3	0.3	
0.3	0.7	BEZOS:
0.8	0.8	I
1	0.7	guess
0.7	1	so.
0.4	0.3	
0.5	0.1	
0	0.9	MCBATH:
0.3	0.4	Okay.
1	0.9	So
0.3	0.6	I
0.4	0.2	wanted
0.9	0.7	to
0.8	0.7	ask
0.3	0.9	you
0.8	0.1	about
0.8	0.8	information
0.5	0.1	that
0.8	0.8	you
0.1	0	require
0.1	0.2	from
0.4	0.5	sellers
0.4	0.7	to
0.6	0.7	prevent
0.6	0.2	the
0.2	0.1	sale
0.2	0.5	of
0.9	0.2	stolen
0.7	1	goods.
0.1	0.5	Do
0.4	0.8	you
0.1	0.4	require
0.4	0.9	a
0.6	0.6	real
0.9	0.6	name
0.1	0.7	and
0.9	0.4	address
0.8	0.6	yes
0.3	0	or
0.7	0.4	no?
0.3	0.2	
0.4	0.9	
0.1	0.7	BEZOS:
0	0.2	For
0.4	0.3	sellers?
0.3	0.9	
0.8	1	
0.2	0.9	MCBATH:
0.9	0.1	Once
0.3	0.5	again,
0.9	0.2	do
0.5	0.8	you
0.1	0.5	require
0	0.9	a
0.5	0.9	real
0.8	0.8	name
0.6	0.4	and
0.4	0.7	address
0.3	0.2	from
0.2	0.5	sellers?
0.8	0.5	
0.9	0.9	
0.2	0.9	BEZOS:
0.8	0.2	I
0.5	0.5	believe
0.3	0.8	we
0.9	0.4	do,
0.1	0.6	but
0.7	0.8	let--let
0.7	0.4	me
0.5	0.7	get
0.3	0	back
0.4	0.6	to
0.6	0.2	your
0.5	0.8	office--I
0.7	0.5	would
0.6	0.9	rather
0.4	0.6	give
0	0.4	you
0.7	0.8	the
0.2	0.4	accurate
0.4	0.9	answer,
0.1	0	but
0.8	0.5	I
0.7	0.3	think
0.4	0.4	we
0.9	0.8	do.
0.6	0.4	
0.3	0.9	
0.4	0.8	MCBATH:
0.5	0.5	And
0.6	0.2	I
0.2	0.5	am
1	0.7	aware
0.2	0.1	that
0.4	0.7	you
1	0.3	are.
0.8	0.1	So
0.8	0.9	yes,
0	0.3	you
0.9	0.3	do
0.6	0.8	require
0.7	0.8	a
0.8	0.1	name
0.1	0.2	and
0.9	0.9	address.
0.6	0.6	Do
0.9	0.9	you
0.8	0.5	require
0.3	0.4	a
0.1	0.9	phone
0	0.5	number,
0.4	0.6	yes
0.9	0.2	or
0.2	0.2	no?
0.4	0.8	
1	0.2	
0.5	0.5	BEZOS:
0.9	0.3	I
1	0.8	don't
0.1	0.3	know
0.1	0.4	if
0.7	0.1	it
0.9	0.8	is
0.7	0.8	required.
0.7	0.4	I
0.1	0.6	think
0.1	0.9	we
0.2	0.6	often
0.7	0	have
0.9	0.9	it,
0.8	0.1	but
0.6	0.6	I
0	0.8	don't
0.9	0.4	know.
0.3	0	
0.4	0.7	
0.5	0.9	MCBATH:
0.7	0.9	So

0.1	0.3	Today
0.2	0.1	we
0.9	0.4	had
0.5	0.7	the
0.3	0.1	opportunity
0.3	0.9	to
0.8	0.7	hear
0.9	0.7	from
0.6	0.3	me
0.1	0.5	decision-makers
0.9	0.8	that

0.5	0.9	This

0.3	0.3	has
0.8	0.3	made
0.5	0.9	one
0.3	0.2	fact
0.6	0.9	clear
0.1	0.1	to
0.2	0.4	me,
0.7	0.5	these
0.2	0.5	companies,
0.2	0.6	as
0.7	0.3	it
0.2	0.6	exists
0.5	0.3	today,
0.8	0.9	have
0.3	0.1	monopoly
0.8	0.9	power.
0.8	0.3	Some

0	0.5	to
0.3	0.8	be
0.5	0.1	broken
0.3	0.4	up,
1	0.9	all
0.6	0.7	need
0.1	0.6	to
0.3	0.9	be
0.3	0.2	properly
0.2	0.2	regulated
0.5	0.7	and
0.4	0.9	held
0.1	0.1	accountable.
0.9	0.2	We
0.6	0.7	need
0.1	0.2	to
0.5	0.7	ensure
0.1	0.7	the
0.3	0.9	antitrust
0.1	0.9	laws
0.5	0.2	first
0.1	0.4	written
0.8	0.5	more

0.7	1	work
0.3	0.8	in
0.3	0.9	the
0.5	1	digital
0.8	0.4	age.
0.5	0.3	When
0.3	0.4	these
0.7	0.3	laws
0.8	0.5	were
0.6	0.4	written,
0.1	0.7	a
0	0.8	monopolist
0.4	0	were
0.8	0.1	men
0.3	0.5	named
0.1	0.4	Rockefeller,
0.6	0.4	and
0.5	0	Carnegie.
0.8	0.3	Their
0.7	0.2	control
0.5	0.4	of
0.7	0.3	the
0.2	0.1	marketplace
0.7	1	allowed
0.6	0.8	them
0.1	0.4	to
0.2	0.6	do
0.3	0.3	whatever
0.8	0.1	it
0.1	0.6	took
0.2	0.4	to
0.3	0.1	crush
0.5	0.3	independent
0.4	0.4	businesses
0.6	0	and
0.2	0.2	expand
0.7	1	their
0.9	0.8	own
0.2	0.4	power.
0.8	0.6	Well,
0.4	0.9	the
0.5	0.1	names
0.2	0.8	have
0.5	0.8	changed,
0.1	0.4	but
0.6	0.8	the
0.9	1	story
0.2	0.1	is
0.3	0.7	the
0.8	0.1	same.
0.4	0.3	Today
0	0.5	the
0.8	1	men
0.9	0.8	are
0.2	0.8	name
0.1	0.3	Zuckerberg,
0.5	0.1	Cook,
0.7	0.4	Pichai,
0.2	0.3	and
0.9	0.9	Bezos.
0.6	0.6	Once
0.5	0.7	again,
0.2	0.3	they
0.7	0.7	controlled--their
0.2	0.1	control
0.1	0.3	of
0.8	0.4	the
0.5	0.6	marketplace
0.3	0.1	allows
0.2	0.8	them
0.4	0.1	to
0.8	0.2	do
0.8	0.2	whatever
0.7	0.7	it
0.4	1	takes
0.9	0.6	to
0.3	0.5	crush
0.5	0.6	independent
0.6	0.6	business
0.5	0.2	and
0.4	1	expand
0.7	0.4	their
0.9	0.8	own
0.4	0.4	power.
0.3	0.1	This
0.2	0.1	must
0.4	0.7	end.
0.4	0.8	The

0.5	0.7	will
